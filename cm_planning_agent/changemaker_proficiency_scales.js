Proficiency Scales for Changemakers course:
-CREATIVITY PROFICIENCY SCALE:
4.0: The learner will: demonstrate in-depth synthesis and application of ideas that show complexity and/or integration.
Novelty and usefulness: Produce a product that reflects a novel and useful idea/solution to address the problem or task objectives with exceptional originality and practicality.
Brainstorming, experimentation, iteration: Shows evidence of multiple design cycles that explore possibilities and generate improvements based on stakeholder feedback
Selecting and Elaborating Synthesizes and combines multiple perspectives to explain how a developed product demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem/task objectives.
3.0:
The learner will:
Creative Product (Products, Ideas, Solutions) - ​​Novelty and usefulness: Produce a product that reflects both a novel and useful idea/solution to address the problem or task objectives.
Creative Thinking Process - Brainstorming, experimentation, iteration:
As part of the design process: Independently generates, iterates and explores a range of ideas with a variety of tools and protocols to address the problem or task objectives.
Selecting and Elaborating:Explain how a developed product demonstrates a detailed understanding of the problem/task objectives.
2.0:
The learner will:
Creative Product (Products, Ideas, Solutions) - ​​Novelty and usefulness: Produce a product that reflects a useful idea/solution to address the problem or task objectives.
Creative Thinking Process - Brainstorming, experimentation, iteration: As part of the design process, generates, iterates and explores a range of ideas with a variety of teacher directed tools and protocols to address the problem or task objectives.
-Selecting and Elaborating: The learner will select a product out of teacher provided options and explain/justify how it addresses the problem or task objectives.
-COLLABORATION PROFICIENCY SCALE:
4.0:The learner will:
Apply and articulate the impact of collaborative practices that are specific to the project context and group dynamic.
For example:
Develop and implement a strategy for your specific team in order to create a more efficient group, keeping in mind the strengths and weaknesses of the team.
Demonstrates self-awareness through the evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of your individual contributions to your team and project.

-CRITICAL THINKING PROFICIENCY SCALE:
4.0: The learner will:
Anticipate potential challenges and adapt thinking proactively when addressing emerging issues.
Synthesize insights across systems, perspectives, or models to uncover or analyze interrelationships, inconsistencies, or counterexamples.
Employ adaptive reasoning to make sense of complexity, question assumptions, integrate new insights, and refine understanding or solutions in response to changing contexts or conflicting information.
Use evidence-based inferences from diverse sources, weighing claims, counterclaims, and limitations.
*For example:Draws logical conclusions about a topic and adapts or applies thinking to other concepts. OR Uses evidence-based inferences and reasoning from multiple sources taking into account the quality and limitations of evidence, claims, and counter-claims.

3.0:The learner will:
Articulate multiple perspectives, arguments related to a complex problem.
Select and apply relevant evidence from varied sources to make and defend claims.
Use systems thinking tools and models (e.g., root cause analysis, iceberg model, pre-mortems) to identify patterns and contributing factors.
Recognize when information may be incomplete, conflicting, or irrelevant. 
2.0: The learner will:
Identify and describe  a single perspective, as it relates to a complex problem
Summarize key ideas from multiple sources.
Identify strengths and limitations of sources using basic criteria (e.g., CRAAP Test).
Use academic language and structure:Claim,Evidence,Source/Viewpoint/Perspective,Credibility,Cause and Effect,MLA citation

-COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY SCALE:
4.0:
The learner will:
Adapt communication tools and strategies to meet the needs of diverse audiences.
Apply a sophisticated level of craftsmanship.
For example:
Extend the quality and depth of the communication by  following, adapting or breaking conventions of a medium or style.
3.0:
The learner will:
Share information in an organized and engaging way within a project/presentation.
Use precise, descriptive and content-specific knowledge to enhance a message.
applies craftsmanship in following conventions of a medium or style.
2.0:
The learner will:
Identify strategies to engage an audience
Plan the organization of a message
Show awareness of the conventions of a medium and elements of craftsmanship
-ACTION & ADVOCACY PROFICIENCY SCALE:
4.0:
The learner will complete a meaningful change that impacts the community or plan for ongoing and sustainable impact in a project. This involves consistent stakeholder involvement, noticeable improvements, and lasting sustainability.
3.0:
The learner will:
Build ongoing connections with the various communities and individuals connected to a project
Implement a solution based on multiple perspectives and feedback
Analyze the impact of the solution, including successes and failures in implementation
2.0:
The learner will:
Plan and prepare for empathy chats
Capture perspectives of stakeholders reflecting complexity of the issue(s)
Propose a change, service opportunity, or action plan based on stakeholder needs

An L1.5 assessment is a quick completion check. An L2 assessment assesses at the 2.0 level (foundational knowledge) and takes more teacher time. An L3 assessment takes longer and is for in-depth proficiency demonstration.
