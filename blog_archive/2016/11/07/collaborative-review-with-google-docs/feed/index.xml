					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/07/collaborative-review-with-google-docs/#comment-487&quot;&gt;Megan Hayes-Golding&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Megan,

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Have you seen any drawbacks to this review method? For example, one I&#039;d be concerned about is students limiting themselves to only studying in this doc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;



As much as I can, I encourage students to use &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; of the resources I&#039;ve posted online in the course of a unit. I also make clear that this is a sample of what I think is useful in the context of what I want students to be able to do, but is not necessarily complete. Part of me objects to structuring &lt;u&gt;any&lt;/u&gt; review and instead providing open time for students to work and ask questions. At this point, I err on the side of providing too much structure.



&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Do you think it would be appreciated if the answers were separated from the questions so no spoilers? My kids asked for that and I see more genuine problem working.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After seeing your comment, I did ask students whether it mattered. A few said they wanted the answers there. What I subsequently observed was students staring at the solutions without necessarily trying the problems themselves. Definitely something to switch for next time. Thanks for the recommendation.

I&#039;ll do some #NaBloCoMo work myself int he coming days. Thanks for the nudge!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It *is* great to have access to Google, I agree! Love how you&#039;ve made your doc ours within minutes is unveiling it.

Two questions/ideas:

1. Have you seen any drawbacks to this review method? For example, one I&#039;d be concerned about is students limiting themselves to only studying in this doc.

2. Do you think it would be appreciated if the answers were separated from the questions so no spoilers? My kids asked for that and I see more genuine problem working.

#NaNoBloCoMo comment 2 from me. Consider paying the comment love forward.]]></description>
