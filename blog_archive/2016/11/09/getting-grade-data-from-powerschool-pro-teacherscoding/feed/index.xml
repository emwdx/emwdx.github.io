I completely agree - I figured (hoped?) that the PowerSchool folks would be adding this feature at some point since it seems so obvious.

I also would love to have grades live in a spreadsheet and periodically upload them to update, perhaps once a week. That would help reduce some of the anxiety students develop over grades being updated instantly. Maybe the PS powers that be are listening?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is useful, although it seems that with the new 10.1 update the feature to download the scoresheet as a .csv has returned. What would be REALLY helpful is a way to go the other way. My systems would connect much better if I could use a .csv to upload grades into PTP as we could with PTG. 

hmmm.... (as well as grrr....)]]></description>
