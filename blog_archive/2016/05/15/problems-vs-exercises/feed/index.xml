I think we are in agreement. I like the distinction you made on practice - problems can be opportunities to demonstrate mastery and understanding, while exercises are more focused on developing fluency. There is a place for all of these in our classrooms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use &#039;problems&#039; to set the stage for productive struggle. I think that parallels what you are saying. Exercises are practice. I also need variations of exercises to check for mastery. I go one step further in that the answers tell me (sometimes) what the child&#039;s misconception may be, and I can address it. I have found a really interesting resource for problems that highlight misconceptions in the GCSE emails I am getting from Craig Barton craig@diagnosticquestions.com]]></description>
