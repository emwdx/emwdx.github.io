I think we&#039;re agreeing for the most part. I want the students to learn concepts well enough that they can apply them in different contexts, not just those in which the concepts were previously presented. I think that is, by definition, deeper learning. I&#039;m not arguing that memorizing names is the level of our expectations. It&#039;s that even for a simple task such as this, we need to vary the context to make the knowledge stick.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Certainly the same is true for me. If I&#039;m in a big lecture hall where students don&#039;t group much with those far away it&#039;s much easier for me. If the students make completely random groups (which sometimes I force) it takes me longer to get their names down but I keep them longer. I certainly agree that there&#039;s a strong analogy with learning but, given my experience, is it better to have the students learn it fast or learn it deep? The problem with deep is it takes so long.]]></description>
