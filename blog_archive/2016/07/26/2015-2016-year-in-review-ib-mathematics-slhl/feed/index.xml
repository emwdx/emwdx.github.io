					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/26/2015-2016-year-in-review-ib-mathematics-slhl/#comment-478&quot;&gt;Diana Fernandez&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Diana,

I&#039;ve shared my year 1 standards &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q-Kn0YYfhrhb-mLUrXBDa9vBUHE96x25RZ6nh-CpcVk/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is a rough ordering of what I did with my combined class. The HL only topics are noted with asterisks. I&#039;ll see about adding the year 2 standards as well to let you know what I did there.

I held off on Calculus until around November of year 2 for the combined class. This worked reasonably well in terms of pacing for the SL students, but the HL students really did not get the time they needed or deserved. If it&#039;s an option, I&#039;d definitely petition your administrators to make separate classes for your year two for the sake of the students. It&#039;s not fair to either group to do otherwise.

The other option to give more time for Calculus if it&#039;s the option you choose (and I still think it&#039;s the better choice given the overlap with SL) is to push Vectors to the end. The topic does serve as a review of some trigonometry and kinematics concepts, so would fit.

Good luck and keep in touch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the reflection! I am about to teach an SL/HL combined class- I was wondering if you had a course outline/work program that you used? I would love to teach the series and differential equations but I&#039;m afraid it will mean I have to teach calculus to the SL students too early. Any advice?]]></description>
