Completely. It&#039;s also an opportunity for us as teachers to recognize that we have students that have the desire to appreciate math the way we do, but due to the systems in place, aren&#039;t allowed the time to do so. It means it&#039;s worth our efforts to slow down for the purpose of allowing deep thinking.]]></description>

I completely agree that this is a shift, and it is ongoing. Clearly, despite the changes I&#039;ve made to the way I teach, students still get the sense that the test is the important part, which means there is still a great deal of improvement yet to be made!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My enjoyment of math comes from the struggle with ideas and the satisfaction I get from my connection of and understanding of the relationships among those ideas. It&#039;s like a huge puzzle that will take the rest of my lifetime to fully understand. This child&#039;s comments resonated with what I see happening with my students. They are not learning math so much as preparing for a test about math. The current situation of &#039;learn how to do this; learn how to do that&#039; mentality is slowwwwly changing over to &#039;understand why this is so; why does this relationship work&#039; exploration. It will need a shift in how we teach, letting kids struggle and connect ideas (we must facilitate this exploration, but not down some tightly designed path), and changing our view of grades and mastery. I can&#039;t say I don&#039;t have the answer- I am working on an answer that works for me and for my students. And I&#039;m sure I am not the only one.]]></description>
