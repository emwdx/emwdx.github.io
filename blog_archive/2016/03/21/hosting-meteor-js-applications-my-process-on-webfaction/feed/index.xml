Ooh...not sure on that one. I&#039;ve found that running npm install in that directory sometime has to happen multiple times. It also happened when I was using the wrong version of node. Updating node and the path variable usually fixed that problem.]]></description>

You have the right idea. If I change the app locally, I have to go through steps 8 - 11 again on a SSH connection through the terminal. There&#039;s actually one extra step in this case, which is using &lt;code&gt;ps -ef &lt;/code&gt; to get the process ID which I subsequently kill before starting a new instance. I have the commands ready to paste in though, so it&#039;s less than 5 minutes to go through those steps on another iteration of the application.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome, I was just looking into hosting some meteor apps on my server at work. My question is: How do you update an app? I assume you&#039;d change your local/development copy and then somehow get it up again on Webfaction? Just wondering how much of a hassle it is once you&#039;ve got the first parts done.]]></description>
