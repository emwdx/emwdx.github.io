I totally agree - the question that comes next doesn&#039;t need to be another question on content. Having that dialogue with the students is likely more informative than another problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that the other big advantage human teachers have over adaptive software is that we can ask, &quot;how did you do this problem?&quot; or &quot;why did you do this first?&quot; or &quot;can you make up a problem similar to this one that would be easier/harder for you?&quot; or a host of other questions that unpack students&#039; thinking and that give us information we can use to create follow-up questions and problems that will challenge the student or allow a misconception to be brought out more clearly. The software only knows that the answer was right or wrong, and that&#039;s significantly less information (I&#039;m not even counting the wealth of information the teacher likely has about the student&#039;s prior work and thinking, disposition towards math, and how to motivate him or her).]]></description>
