Two main reasons:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These projects are a lot more fun if you can collect data, store it, and display it in some way. Meteor makes it really easy to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing what I create through running on a web page is a lot easier to share than a Python script, which requires installation of Python or the knowledge of how to access it another way (through a terminal, or an in-browser code site). It isn&#039;t that difficult to get code in another language running, but it&#039;s an extra step that makes the difference between someone checking out my work or not. Everyone has a web browser, which means everyone can run Javascript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;]]></description>

Thanks, Evan, for sharing your reason. I hope you publish the post soon. On the other hand, why did you need javascript? The only what I realize is to put dynamic fields (which grow with data)]]></description>

Hi Xavier,

I think it might be time for another blog post detailing my reasons for going full Meteor. Those reasons are even stronger now than they were when I first started moving that way 2+ years ago, which seems a bit weird in retrospect now that my coding skills have developed a bit more. The short story is that I got tired of managing two different languages - Python in the back (where I also used Bottle) and Javascript in the front. Meteor lets the entire stack be written in Javascript, which lends itself to a much smoother development experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Evan, for sharing the source. A question: why do you choose Meteor and not other frameworks? I had experiences with flask and bottle (python).

On the other hand, I have seen you have used very much the web frameworks for making class: reservation of exams, etc. Can you please tell us a little bit more about where and how to use these tools and what are their benefits?

Thanks,]]></description>

Thanks for the heads up, Phil. Apparently Chrome and Firefox don&#039;t like TIF image files. I&#039;ve replaced it with a JPG and it seems to be working better.]]></description>
