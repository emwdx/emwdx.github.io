Hi Brian,

This is a single assessment on all of the standards of a unit. I&#039;ll occasionally throw on some questions that tap standards from previous units as well, which is more important in the IB classes than with my ninth graders. 

The questions I give are almost entirely short answer questions since these tend to be better for identifying difficulties. Multiple choice questions that do this, unless really well designed, are few and far between.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like how you combine all the assessment information into one sheet. Two questions come to mind:
1. Are the questions across the top all on the same test/quiz? Or is this an aggregation of all of the quizzes you&#039;ve given?
2. Are your quizzes open-ended (solution/process based)? Or does it depend on the day?

I&#039;m curious because I&#039;m doing something similar, but only for my summative assessments right now which are a blend of MC and short answer. I&#039;d like to keep more longitudinal information this way to match it up with their performance at the end.]]></description>
