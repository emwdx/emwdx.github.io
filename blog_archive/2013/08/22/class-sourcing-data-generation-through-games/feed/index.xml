Hi Jonathan,

That sounds like a great solution - definitely a better deal in terms of getting the data in the hands of the students as quickly as possible. If Google Docs wasn&#039;t blocked here in China (and if I wasn&#039;t looking for a reason to play with the Meteor JS framework, I&#039;d be right there with you.

Let me know how it goes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to run this locally, but I realized that I could do this with Google Forms so I think I&#039;ll do it that way.  I&#039;ll be able to share the &quot;results&quot; spreadsheet with everyone, and they&#039;d have instant access to the results, and a tool for manipulating the numbers.  Thanks for this awesome idea, however!  Definitely better than asking them to measure 50 of their friends&#039;/peers&#039; shoe sizes (I&#039;ve done that the past 2 years and you&#039;re right: they&#039;re just not as into it as you&#039;d hope they&#039;d be).]]></description>
