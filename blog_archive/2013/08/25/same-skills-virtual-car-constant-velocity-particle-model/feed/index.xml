					<description><![CDATA[Hi Evan: 
1) I commend you on thinking quickly on your feet to solve the problems you had to face. I hope you shared this experience with your students so that they realize that life does not come ready for us in a golden platter; rather we must face its challenges with whatever multitude of skills and doggedness we have. Kudos!

2) For motion modeling, I use the students themselves to add kinesthetic fun to the whole experience. I split the students onto 4 groups with one group being the timers. The challenge of the three motion groups is to execute a relay (without watches of their own) in such a way that the end result will be a model of specs I give them ahead of time. That&#039;s it, I do not give any further instructions beyond this. The results get entered, reviewed,  compared, and the fun is indescribable. Low tech but still cool modeling with humans themselves &quot;feeling&quot; the motion and the Physix.

3) So, keep the human element as an option for it may work too.

Thank you and take great care! :-)]]></description>
