					<description><![CDATA[As a math teacher at an alternative hs, I implement this method quite regularly. Being honest, I totally understand what you mean when being in front of the kids helps manage, and being off to one side you can see non-productivity. However, mirroring what you have said about gains, the kids really are learning more this way. They have that chance to dig in, and try it with each other.

In order to help manage the behavior, I actually turned all of my desks in to whiteboards (they were the 8ft tables you can buy at nearly any hardware store / party supply store) and use the whiteboard as my instructional component to target the smaller groups of kids in order to help manage my time and to help pull some of my &quot;off-taskers&quot; back in. That way the kids can manipulate right infront of them what it is you are working with.

So far that approach has brought engagement with the content up, and better yet overall scores. But realistically, that could change with next years group!

I wish you the best of luck, and look forward to hearing more of what you&#039;re planning on working on!]]></description>
