Hi Matthew (which I can only assume is your name from your awesome name there),

Are you referring to the graphic on my page or Dan&#039;s? The question on adding polynomials doesn&#039;t have any student examples up on my post. The student work in the two images in the post was given in response to the question just above it in the image.]]></description>

Hi Sean,

It certainly isn&#039;t the only way - I&#039;ve seen students working on algebra long enough to know that I&#039;d get all three responses(identity, no solution, x = 0). There&#039;s something great about showing these things in work that was generated in the room, during the class period though. I&#039;ve done the whole &#039;I&#039;ve seen this mistake before&#039; thing where I put up the mistake and ask students to respond and explain what&#039;s wrong with it, but it never seems to hit the crowd as well as work that came from the students themselves.

As for &#039;My favorite no&#039;, I had never heard about it until I very recently. I knew my idea wasn&#039;t original. I&#039;m glad to know there&#039;s a great name (and online following) for that activity already out there. I&#039;ll definitely include this fully formed activity in future classes. 

Thanks for your comments!]]></description>

Hi,

I like this, but it&#039;s too time consuming for me with one scanner. For individual students sending me their work outside of class, a single scanner works just fine. When I&#039;m trying to look for good stuff to show the class though, having them all send simultaneously reduces that dead time of waiting or lining up at the scanner to submit their work.

Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

Hi Shannon,

I had students snap pictures of their work in their own notebooks, so there&#039;s no reason you couldn&#039;t have them submit from a worksheet that you provide. There are apps on iPad that help do this - check out Cathy Yenca&#039;s post about nearpod here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathycathy.com/blog/2013/01/so-simple-get-every-kid-to-the-board-with-nearpod/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; There are others. I use my own programs primarily because many of the other online solutions work slowly when accessing them from China. There is other stuff available. Let me know how it goes for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Evan, I really like this and was wondering if there was a way to have students send pictures of their work simply from a worksheet instead of the online component or an online assignment from Edmodo, for example. I would like to start collecting their work on the fly even before I get so technological with them. FYI our district is going 1 to 1 with ipads in 2 weeks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was intrigued by your idea as I have been trying something similar to gather the data of my student&#039;s work as they complete a quiz or exam.  My method is to use a duplex scanner that students put their work into, press the button, and it is scanned into dropbox folder.  I can review work electronically as it is completed by the students or later if I wish.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Evan, thanks for this. Great.

&quot;The only way I get this information is by looking at student work.&quot;

1. &quot;The only way.&quot; I wonder: could you have predicted that some kids would have said zero, some identity, and so on? Or was it a complete surprise? Trying to process how to anticipate student misconceptions and more efficiently expose them. 

2. There&#039;s &quot;my favorite no,&quot; which seems to get at what you&#039;re writing about here?

I tried it once - the speed issues running this (and socrative.com) from China make it unusable. It&#039;s possible this is also a China Great Firewall issue given other things that have been blocked.

There are tons of tools out there that have features that do this sort of thing, but the blocking requires that I come up with my own local solutions.]]></description>
