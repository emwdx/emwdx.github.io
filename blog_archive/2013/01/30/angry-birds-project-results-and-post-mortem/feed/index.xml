					<description><![CDATA[&#062;&#062;  I need to be a lot more aware of the level of my own excitement around activity in comparison to that of the students.
Boy!  You hit the nail on the head with that one!  As much as we try to find interesting problems to illustrate topics, I think it will always come down to - interesting to whom, the students or the teacher?  And we are a few years apart.
Right now I am intrigued that you can place a Super Bowl bet on the over/under of how long it will take Alicia Keys to sing the National Anthem. Someone collected prior data on this, and it sounded like a good problem for my statistics class.  But I decided while this is interesting to me, I don&#039;t think it would be interesting to my students.
Thanks for your insights.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post--that&#039;s something I rarely think about: the delivery of the &quot;awesome&quot; lesson I just created.  I like how you made it about &quot;which team won?&quot; rather than &quot;how close did you get?&quot;--that&#039;s sure to catch students&#039; attention better.  So often I get excited about lessons I&#039;ve made because I think they&#039;re fun and I forget that just because I&#039;m excited, doesn&#039;t mean the students are. And so often, my excitement doesn&#039;t rub off on them the way I want it to.  It&#039;s a helpful reminder that sometimes it&#039;s just the &quot;hook&quot; that I need to work on and not the lesson as a whole.  Thanks!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who has spent loving hours developing projects that were summarily rejected by students, i feel your pain. But you still have to give it up. And then recognize that kids prefer to play with the box than the toy within.
A useful strategy now might be to ask the students to produce their own project. You usually get at least one you can build on for next year...
Good work!]]></description>
