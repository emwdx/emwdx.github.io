					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/06/28/makeovermonday-sun-room-carpet/#comment-208&quot;&gt;Lucia&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Lucia, 

I stand corrected, now that I have seen Dan&#039;s post. I still maintain that it is distracting, but I retract my statement that it is an artificially inserted complication.

On a related note, if you haven&#039;t seen the White House response to a petition on changing to metric, it is a hoot:

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, since the problem comes from Canada-
&quot;This task comes from MathWorks, which, as I understand it, is intended for Canada&#039;s vocational track math students.&quot; -Dan Meyer&#039;s post

-students have to learn how to think in feet with metric measurements. Our largest trade partner has decided to stick with Imperial, so this woman could very well have measured her room looking at meters and gone to the store realizing that the carpet she wants is sold by the foot.

C&#039;est la vie!
For example: we buy gas by the litre, but still refer to MPG; older generations still refer to weather in Fahrenheit, so us young people have to remind ourselves that our blood won&#039;t boil when we hear it will be 100 degrees the next day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me, there&#039;s nothing to critique here. You&#039;ve clarified what&#039;s important and turned a routine problem into something that makes students curious. It&#039;s obvious you have spent a lot of time on this. Teachers and students are the beneficiaries. Thanks!]]></description>
