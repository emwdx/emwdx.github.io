    <!-- .entry-header -->
    <h2> Overview</h2>
<p>This was my third time around teaching the first year of the IB mathematics SL sequence. It was different from my previous two iterations given that this was not an SL/HL combined class. This meant that I had more time available to do explorations, problem solving sessions, and in-class discussions of the internal assessment (also called the exploration). I had two sections of the class with fourteen and twenty students respectively.</p>
<p>I continued to use standards based grading for this course. You can find my standards (which define the curricular content for my year one course) at this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19mmLEg1_zTErxHCGsw9bkkZybUNm7QhJrszxo4TOZto/edit?usp=sharing">IB Mathematics SL Year 1 &#8211; Course Standards</a></p>
<h2> What worked:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>My model of splitting the 80 &#8211; 85 minute block into twenty minute blocks of time works well.</strong> I can plan what happens in those sub-blocks, and try as hard as I can to keep students <u>doing</u> something for as much of those as I can. The first block is a warm-up, some discussion, check in about homework or whatever, and then usually some quick instruction before the next block, which often involves an exploration activity. Third is summary of explorations or the preceding activities, example problems, and then a fourth of me circulating and helping students work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Buffer days, which I threw in as opportunities for students to work on problems, ask questions, and play catch up, were a big hit.</strong> I did little more on these days than give optional sets of problems and float around to groups of students. Whenever I tried to just go over something quick on these days, those lessons quickly expanded to fill more time than intended. It took a lot of discipline to instead address issues as they came up. </li>
<li>
<strong>I successfully did three writing assignments in preparation for the internal assessment, which students will begin writing officially at the beginning of year two.</strong> Each one focused on a different one of the criteria, and was given at the end of a unit. Giving students opportunities to write, and get feedback on their writing, was useful both for planning purposes and for starting the conversation around bad habits now.
<p>I had rolling deadlines for these assignments, which students submitted as Google Docs. I would go through a set of submissions for a class, give feedback to those that made progress, and gentle reminders to those that hadn&#8217;t. The final grade that went into PowerSchool was whatever grade students had earned by the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>The principle I applied here (and one to which I have subscribed more fervently with each year of teaching) is that my most valuable currency in the classroom is feedback. Those that waited to get started in earnest with these didn&#8217;t get the same amount of feedback as students that started early, and the quality of their work suffered dramatically. I&#8217;m glad I could have the conversations I had with students now so that I might have a chance in changing their behavior before their actual IA is due. </p>
<p>An important point &#8211; although I did comment on different elements of the rubric, most of my feedback was on the criterion that titled the assignment. For example, in my feedback I occasionally referenced reflection and mathematical presentation in the communication assignment. I gave the most detailed feedback for communication, and graded solely on that criterion. </p>
<p>These were the assignments: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JIOl4XQj7RXnKm-TF7i9G5Wx8kfePcHEs_ZvKe0ynwo">Mathematical Presentation &#8211; Modeling Periodic Phenomena Link</a> </li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ygU1Xc-BMWPx_Tqtopz08C6SV5O3Ep3167CsJNHnmU/edit?usp=sharing">Communication &#8211; Mission Drone Intercept</a>. I <a href="/2017/06/04/building-models-drone-intercept-and-desmos/">wrote previously about the activity that preceded the writing for this assignment.</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>I budgeted some of my additional instruction time for explicit calculator instruction.</strong> I&#8217;ve argued previously about the limitations of graphing calculators compared to Geogebra, Desmos, and other tools that have substantially better user experiences. The reality, however, is that these calculators are what students can access during exams. Without some level of fluency accessing the features, they would be unable to solve some problems. <a href="/2016/07/26/2015-2016-year-in-review-ib-mathematics-slhl/">I wrote about this in my review of the course last year.</a> This time was well spent, as students were not tripped up by questions that could only be solved numerically or graphically.</li>
<li>Students saw many past paper questions, and seem to have some familiarity with the style of questions that are asked.</li>
</ul>
<h2> What needs work:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that preemptive advice is ineffective.</strong> &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to [&#8230;]&#8221; or &#8220;You need to be extremely careful when you [&#8230;]&#8221; is what I&#8217;m talking about. It isn&#8217;t useful for students that don&#8217;t need the reminder. It doesn&#8217;t help the students that don&#8217;t have a context for what you are telling them not to do, not having solved problems on their own. I have found it to be much more effective to address those mistakes after students get burned by them. Some of my success here comes from my students subscribing to a growth mindset, which is something I push pretty hard from the beginning. Standards based grading helps a lot here too.</li>
<li>
<strong>I desperately need a better way to encourage longer retention of knowledge, particularly in the context of a two year IB course.</strong> I&#8217;ll comment more on this in a later post, but standards based grading and the quarter system combined were factors working against this effort. I did some haphazard spaced repetition of topics on assessments in the form of longer form section two questions. The fact that I was doing this did not incentivize enough students to regularly review. I also wonder if my conflicted beliefs on fluency versus understanding of process play a role as well. </li>
<li>
<strong>Students consistently have a <u>lot</u> of questions about rounding, reporting answers, and follow through in using those answers in the context of IB grading.</strong> The rules are explicitly stated in the mark schemes for questions &#8211; answers should be reported exactly or to three significant figures unless otherwise noted. The questions students repeatedly have relate to multiple part questions. For example, if a student does a calculation in part (a), reports it to three significant figures, and then uses the exact answer to answer part (b), might that result in a wrong answer according to the mark scheme? What if the student uses the three significant figure reported answer in a subsequent part?
<p>I did a lot of research in the OCC forum and reading past papers to try to fully understand the spirit of what IB tries to do. I&#8217;d like to believe that IB sides with students that are doing the mathematics correctly. I am not confident in my ability to explain what the IB believes on this, which means my students are uncertain too. This bothers me a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Students still struggle to remember the nuances of the different command terms during assessments. </strong> They also will do large amounts of complex calculations and algebraic work in site of seeing that a question is only two or three marks. There is clearly more work to do on that, though I expect that will improve as we move into year two material because, well, it usually does. I wish there was a way to start the self-reflection process earlier.</li>
<li>
<strong>Students struggle to write about mathematics.</strong> They also struggle with the reality that there is <u>no</u> way to make it go faster or do it at the last minute without the quality suffering. I still believe that the way you get better is by writing more and getting feedback, and that&#8217;s the main reason I&#8217;m glad I made the changes I did regarding the exploration components. That said, students know how to write filler paragraphs, and I call them out on filler every single time.</li>
<li>We spent a full day brainstorming and thinking about possible topics for individual explorations. Surveying the students, only four of them are certain about their topics. The rest have asked for additional guidance, which I am still figuring out how to provide over the summer. <strong>I think this process of finding viable topics remains difficult for students.</strong>  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll be following these students to year two. We have the rest of probability to do first thing when we get back, which I&#8217;ll combine with some dedicated class time devoted toward the exploration. I like pushing the probability and Calculus to year two, as these topics are, by definition, plagued by uncertainty. It&#8217;s an interesting context in which to work with students in their final year of high school. </p>

    <!-- .entry-header -->
    <h2> Overview</h2>
<p>This was the first time I taught a true PreCalculus course in six years. At my current school, the course serves the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparing tenth grade students for IB mathematics SL or HL in their 11th grade year. Many of these students were strong 9th grade students that were not yet eligible to enter the IB program since this must begin in grade eleven.</li>
<li>Giving students the skills they need to be successful in Advanced Placement Calculus in their junior or senior year. </li>
<li>Providing students interested in taking the SAT II in mathematics some guidance in the topics that are covered by that exam.</li>
</ul>
<p>For some students, this is also the final mathematics course taken in high school. I decided to design the course to extend knowledge in Algebra 2, continue developing problem solving skills, do a bit more movement into abstraction of mathematical ideas, and provide a baseline for further work in mathematics. I cut some topics that I used to think were essential to the course, but did not properly serve the many different pathways that students can follow in our school. Like Algebra 2, this course can be the swiss army knife course that &#8220;covers&#8221; a lot so that students have been exposed to topics before they really need to learn them in higher level math courses. I always think that approach waters down much of the content and the <u>potential</u> for a course like this. What tools are going to be the most useful to the broadest group of students for developing their fluency, understanding, and communication of mathematical ideas? I designed my course to answer that question.</p>
<p>I also found that this course tended to be the one in which I experimented the most with pedagogy, class structure, new tools, and assessment. </p>
<p>The learning standards I used for the course can be found here:<br>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqZeoIZmVjK8aYTDPsza1y2I3Xx5vXazTrnOVi-iF4k/edit?usp=sharing">PreCalculus 2016-2017 Learning Standards</a></p>
<h2> What worked:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I did some assessments using <a href="https://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk/">Numbas</a>, Google Forms, and the Moodle built-in quizzes to aid with grading and question generation. I liked the concept, but some of the execution is still rough around the edges. None of these did exactly what I was looking for, though I think they could each be hacked into a form that does. I might be too much of a perfectionist to ever be happy here.</li>
<li>For the trigonometry units, I offered computer programming challenges that were associated with each learning standard. Some students chose to use their spreadsheet or Python skills to write small programs to solve these challenges. It was not a large number of students, but those that decided to take these on reported that they liked the opportunity to think differently about what they were learning.</li>
<li>I explicitly also taught using spreadsheet functions to develop student&#8217;s computational thinking skills. This required designing some problems that were just too tedious to solve by hand. This was fun.</li>
<li>Differentiation in this course was a challenge, but I was happy with some of the systems I used to manage it. As I have found is common since moving abroad, many students are computationally well developed, but not <i>conceptually</i> so. Students would learn tricks in after school academy that they would try to use in my course, often in inappropriate situations. I found a nice balance between problems that started low on the ladder of abstraction, and those that worked higher. All homework assignments for the course in Semester 2 were divided into Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 questions so that students could decide what would be most useful for them.</li>
<li>I did some self-paced lessons with students in groups using a range of resources, from <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy </a>to <a href="https://openstax.org/">OpenStax</a>. Students reported that they generally liked when I structured class this way, though there were requests for more direct instruction among some of the students, as I described in mu <a href="/2017/06/19/2016-2017-year-in-review-surveys/">previous post about the survey results</a>. </li>
<li>There was really no time rush in this course since after my decision to cut out vectors, polar equations, linear systems, and some other assorted topics that really don&#8217;t show up again except in Mathematics HL or Calculus BC where it&#8217;s worth seeing the topic again anyway. Some students also gave very positive feedback regarding the final unit on probability. I took my time with things there. Some of this was out of necessity when I was out sick for ten days, but there were many times when I thought about stepping up the challenge faster than I really needed to. </li>
</ul>
<h2> What needs work:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wrote about <a href="/2017/04/19/an-experiment-swapping-numerical-grades-for-skill-levels-and-emoji/">how I did the conic sections unit with no-numerical grades &#8211; just comments in the grade book </a>. The decision to do that was based on a number of factors. The downside was that when I switched back to numerical grades for the final unit, the grade calculation for the entire quarter was based only on those grades, and not on the conic sections unit at all. The conic sections unit did appear on the final exam, but for the most part, there wasn&#8217;t any other consequence for students that did not reassess on the unit.</li>
<li>Students did not generally like <a href="/2017/04/07/trello-for-class-organization/">when I used Trello</a>. They liked the concept of breaking up lessons into pieces and tasks. They did not like the forced timelines and the extra step of the virtual Trello board for keeping track of things. <a href="https://medium.com/newboco/why-physical-scrum-boards-and-clothespins-work-b17d69b3fd12">This Medium article makes me wonder</a> about doing this in an analog form if I try it in the future. I also could make an effort to instill the spirit of Scrum early on so that it&#8217;s less novel, and more the way things are in my classroom.</li>
<li>I should have done a lot more assessment at the beginning of units to see what students knew and didn&#8217;t know. It sounds like the student experiences in the different Algebra 2 courses leading to PreCalculus were quite different, which led to a range of success levels throughout. Actually, I should probably be doing this more often for <u>all</u> my courses.</li>
<li>Students could create their own small reference sheet for every exam. I did this because I didn&#8217;t want students memorizing things like double angle identities and formulas for series. The reason this needs work is that some students are still too reliant on having this resource available to ever reach any level of procedural fluency. I know what students need to be fluent later on in the more advanced courses, sure, but I am not convinced that memorization is the way to get there. Timed drills don&#8217;t seem to do it either. This challenge is compounded by the fact that not all students <u>need</u> that level of fluency for future courses, so what role does memorization here play? I have <a href="/2012/04/17/topic-for-mathchat-do-we-need-students-to-reach-automaticity/">struggled with this</a> in every year of my fourteen year career, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s getting resolved anytime soon. This is especially the case when Daniel Willingham, who generally makes great points that I agree with, writes articles<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/sunday/you-still-need-your-brain.html?_r=0"> like this one</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This course was fun on many levels. I like being there to push students to think more abstractly as they form the foundation of skills that will lead to success in higher levels of mathematics. I like also crafting exercises and explorations that engage and equip the students that are finishing their mathematics careers. We should be able to meet the needs of both groups in one classroom at this stage. </p>
<p>I frequently reminded myself of the big picture by reading through <a href="http://infinitesums.com/precal/">Jonathan Claydon&#8217;s posts on his own Precalc</a> course development over the years. If you haven&#8217;t checked him out, you should. It&#8217;s also entertaining to pester him about a resource he posted a few years ago and hear him explain how much things have changed since then. </p>

    <!-- .entry-header -->
    <h2> Overview</h2>
<p>Last year I took <a href="https://ispeakmath.org/2016/05/17/my-teacher-evaluation-survey/">Julie Reubach&#8217;s survey</a> and used it for the students in my final set of classes at my previous school. This year I gave essentially the same survey. Probably the most important thing for me was to compare some of the results to make sure the essential elements of my teaching identity made the transition intact. </p>
<h2> The positives:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students responded that the reassessments and the quizzing system were important elements to keep for next year. I&#8217;ll share more about my reflection on the reassessment system in a later post.</li>
<li>Students liked having plenty of time during class to work and get help if they needed it. I tried to strike a balance between this, exploration, and direct instruction. More on that last point below.</li>
<li>Students appreciated the structures of class and the materials. They liked having warm-up activities for each class, the organization of documents on Google Drive, and the use of PearDeck for assssment of their ideas during class.</li>
<li>The stories, personal anecdotes, and jokes at the start of class apparently go over well with students. I don&#8217;t think I could stop this completely anyway, so I&#8217;m glad students don&#8217;t necessarily see this as being unfocused or as a waste of class time. </li>
<li>Students like structured opportunities to work together and solve problems that are not just sets from the handouts. Explorations got strong reviews, which is good because I think they are good uses of class time too.</li>
</ul>
<h2> What needs work:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students want more example problems. I consistently did <u>some</u>
</li>
</ul>
<p> in each class, but I always struggled with the balance between doing more problems and addressing issues as they came up individually. Some students want a bit more guidance that doesn&#8217;t necessarily require whole group instruction, but say that the individual group explanations or suggestions aren&#8217;t meeting their needs completely. This might mean I record some videos or present worked problems as part of the class resources in case students want them.
</p>
<li>Related to the previous point is the use of homework, Some students want more help on homework, but again don&#8217;t necessarily want to spend whole class instruction doing it. I admit that I still struggle with the usefulness of going over homework, particularly as a whole class and collecting information on what students struggled with is not smooth. The classroom notebook doesn&#8217;t solve that problem to my satisfaction either. Short, focused presentations of how to get started on certain problems (and not full solutions) might be all that is needed to meet this shortcoming that many students mentioned in their surveys. </li>
<li>Despite my efforts to <a href="/2017/01/18/unit-circle-practice-teacherscoding/">make learning the unit circle easier</a>, students continue to report their dislike for learning it. I present students a series of approaches to understanding how to evaluate functions around the unit circle. This is also one of the few topics where I encourage both understanding (through creative assessment questions) and accuracy in evaluating functions correctly using whatever means students find necessary. Memorization, if that is what students choose to do, is one way that students could approach this. I think part of the issue is that proficiency in this topic requires more genuine effort than others. There are no shortcuts here, and facility with evaluating trigonometric functions goes a long way in making other topics easier. I&#8217;m not sure what the solution is here. This is one area where I think procedural fluency had no valid replacement, particularly in the context of IB, or preparation in Precalculus.</li>
<li>The other topic that students reported they found the most difficult was binomial theorem, again surprising given that it is one of the more procedurally straight forward topics of the courses. <strong>Do I need to consider teaching these in a more formulaic way so that students are more successful?</strong> I wonder if I have swung too far in the wrong direction with respect to avoiding activities that demand fluency or practice. </li>
<li>Students want more summary of what we&#8217;ve done each class and where we are going. I think this is a completely valid request, and is perhaps made easier to do with each course defined in terms of learning standards.</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I appreciate how consistently students are willing to give feedback about my classes. There were some really useful individual comments that will help me think about how the decisions I make might affect the spectrum of students in each course. I promised students that I wouldn&#8217;t look at the results until after grades were in, just in case that might encourage more honesty. This was an anonymous survey, and with the larger class sizes this year, I think there was a closer amount of anonymity with respect to individual responses. There is a lot to sift through here, which is why I&#8217;m glad I still have the better part of the summer to do so.</p>

    <!-- .entry-header -->
    <h2> Overview</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a pretty heavy user of technology. I&#8217;ve been more careful in the past few years to use it for a reason, not for its own sake though. I also balance that use though with a healthy desire to try new things in a way that I would actually use them in the classroom. </p>
<p>This is also the first year I&#8217;ve been able to take advantage of the Google Tools suite since Vietnam is not subject to the limitations of China&#8217;s Great Firewall. Though there have been times when the internet connection to the entire country has been <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/sharks-are-eating-the-internet-in-vietnam-9962747.html">subject to shark attacks</a>, connections in general have been smooth. Seeing how effectively some folks use Google in the classroom after being unable to use it for six years make me feel seriously behind the times. Luckily, my colleagues are really eager to share what they do. I might be caught up.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Macbook Pro where I do most of my lesson planning. I connected an external widescreen monitor that mirrored all projected content. The second screen was sent through AirPlay to an Apple TV, which was then connected to the projector.</li>
<li>Class worksheets electronically created and stored in Google Docs. These are printed out on A5 size sheets for students to tape into their notebooks for a physical record of what we did.</li>
<li>For IB Mathematics SL and PreCalculus, I had two students per class make an additional Google Doc that was a copy of the handout. In this document, students would paste solutions to class work, homework, and whatever else they thought might be important to their classmates. The student responsibility for doing this was on a rotating schedule, similar to what I&#8217;ve used in my previous classes.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://gingerlabs.com/">Notability app</a> for class notes, with a Wacom Tablet for input. I used the wireless accessory kit for around two days, because it disconnected too frequently.</li>
<li>iPhone as a document camera for capturing student work for sharing answers or for conversation during the class. I would take pictures of student work and use AirDrop to upload them for inclusion in the notes.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> as a repository for all of the above documents and links. I also used it occasionally for distributing quizzes and automatic grading.</li>
<li>My <a href="/2016/12/06/scaling-reassessments-yet-again-part-3/">WeinbergCloud</a> website for managing, assigning, and recording reassessments throughout the semester.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.peardeck.com/">PearDeck</a> on a trial basis for first semester, and then regularly during second. I sometimes used an iPad to manage the class, but every time I regretted it, and just used my computer.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos Calculator</a> usually at least once per lesson</li>
<li>
<a href="http://teacher.desmos.com/">Desmos Activity Builder</a> about once per unit per course</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.edpuzzle.com/">EdPuzzle</a> for self paced lessons, videos, and quizzes in Algebra 2. Most of the videos were produced by my colleague, Scott Hsu.</li>
<li>Spreadsheets for building useful calculators (like discriminants for quadratics, arithmetic/geometric series sums, etc)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> for practice exercises and monitoring of student effort in reviewing material.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.geogebra.org/">Geogebra</a> for checking exam questions and demonstrating its use as a work-checking tool for students.</li>
<li>Camtasia for recording videos from time to time of solving problems, using </li>
<li>
<a href="https://quizster.co/">Quizster</a> as a way to have students submit specific homework problems for feedback.</li>
<li>Wireless keyboard and trackpad, though these lasted about a week and a half.</li>
<li>I dabbled with <a href="http://www.goformative.com/">GoFormative</a>, primarily when I was on sick leave for a while. Connection issues that were inconsistent across the class led to my abandoning it for regular use.</li>
<li>For two units in PreCalculus, I used <a href="http://www.trello.com/">Trello</a> as a way to organize units and help students organize their work for each day of class.</li>
</ol>
<h2> What worked:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The process of cutting and pasting images of problems or student work into Notability, and then annotating them was great for recording important information during class. These notes were then either pasted into the document created by students for each class, or exported as PDF for posting on Moodle. This felt like a good way to have a record of what went on during a given class block in case students missed a block.</li>
<li>I liked automated grading of quizzes through Google forms and Moodle. This definitely saved time, but the process of getting feedback to students in response still is awkward. When student work is analog, but answer checking is digital, where should that feedback go? Quizster offers some way of making all of this occur in the same tool, but the workflow never was smooth enough to fully commit to it.</li>
<li>The combination of PearDeck and Desmos Activity builder, along with photos of student work, made for great sources of understanding (and misunderstanding) that helped me decide how or whether to proceed with other material. These also made for great motivating elements for direct instruction when it needed to happen. The students really liked using these tools, and said they looked forward to them, according to the end of year survey results.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t think Khan Academy exercises work well for assessing students beyond a basic level. I think they can provide the practice some students need on procedural skills like factoring or evaluating trigonometric functions. It&#8217;s just one tool among many to serve the needs of my students. </li>
<li>When I provided guidance on how spreadsheets could be used for more than just making charts, students appreciated it. One student went so far as to say that this instruction was &#8220;actually useful&#8221;. I decided not to ask what this student thought about the rest of the class.</li>
</ul>
<h2> What needs work:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I posted homework problems on the printed class handout, digital handout, and on a dedicated document for assignments that is an expectation across classes our high school division. Consistently updating all three documents was a challenge, despite my best efforts.</li>
<li>The student notebook entries for each class were among the least favorite element of the class, as reported by students. I&#8217;ve written previously about the need to have <u>some</u> record of what happens during class, but frustration over students that do not produce their own record through regular use of a dedicated notebook. This isn&#8217;t the best solution, but I think it&#8217;s the closest I&#8217;ve come to something that actually reaches the right balance. I just wish I could figure out how to get students to buy into its usefulness.</li>
<li>I still have not figured out the best way to bring the class back together after letting them work at their own pace through lessons. The only times it makes a lot of sense to do this is at the very beginning of class, and at the very end.</li>
<li>PearDeck, Desmos Activity Builder, and GoFormative each offer features that I really like. None of them do everything. I&#8217;m ok with this, but I wonder whether the fragmentation of activities is good for students, or a problem since their work is distributed across these tools. </li>
<li>While <u>I</u> liked using Trello, and some students reported that they also appreciated it, many students did not. I&#8217;m not sure if it actually is the self-paced lesson tool I&#8217;m looking for, but it was better than a static Google document.</li>
<li>At the end of the year, despite my own research and attempts to improve this, the Apple TV disconnected at least once every class period, if not more frequently.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My focus continues to be on using technology to free up time for the ways that I can best add value in the classroom. Many students don&#8217;t need my help in making progress. Some do, and some like having me explain ideas to them. It&#8217;s hard to simultaneously meet these different needs without technology, which enables me to be in multiple places at once. </p>
<p>Having the range of tools I describe above, and not fully committing to one, is both a blessing and a curse. The fragmentation means the residue of learning is distributed across many web addresses. The variety helps keeps students (and me) from getting into a rut. I don&#8217;t know if this balance is appropriately tuned yet.</p>

    <!-- .entry-header -->
    <h2> Overview</h2>
<p>This was my first year since 2010 being the new kid in school. Developing a reputation takes time, so I was deliberate about establishing who I am as a teacher from the beginning. <a href="/2016/08/16/fail-early-fail-often-learning-names/">I wrote about learning</a> names at the beginning of the year, for example. My school, surpassing 1,000 students this year, is the second largest of those at which I have worked. The high school division is just over 320 students. There are many systems that are in place to manage the reality of this group of ninth through twelfth graders that has a tremendous diversity of interests, programs (IB and AP), extra-curricular organizations, and obligations outside of the school walls. I walked in admittedly intimidated by the scope of this place and what it aims to accomplish.</p>
<p>After one of our meetings before student orientation, there was a lot of information that had been shared. I asked our high school principal what the priority needed to be in the first quarter in terms of processing all of that information. He put me at ease &#8211; the focus should be on figuring out how this place works. He promised (and certainly delivered) on a pledge to remind us of what was important throughout the year, but with the understanding that there would be a learning curve for our group of newbies. The faculty is passionate about teaching and creative in how they go about designing classroom experiences. They were intensely committed to sharing what they do and helping those of us that were new how to prioritize at any given time.</p>
<h2> What worked:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of school was was a mix of content and getting to know them/me activities that were deliberately designed for those purposes. This sort of thing is important at the beginning of any year if the composition of a class is new. It&#8217;s essential if the <i>teacher</i> is new too. Each group is unique and has chemistry that not only is important to suss out in the beginning, but must be regularly assessed as the year proceeds. I thought this series of activities worked really well. I will modify these for the purpose of offering variety for next year&#8217;s student groups, but not really improvement.</li>
<li>I was able to get most of my work preparing lessons at school during my prep periods. Exceptions were after exams, the end of the year, and near reporting deadlines. This required serious levels of prioritization and disciplined decisions around what I actually could accomplish in those blocks of time. While I maintained to-do lists, a major component of my success came from block-scheduling those tasks and sticking to the schedule. This left time after school and at home to spend designing the explorations, experiments, and bigger picture puzzles that were nice, but not necessary. </li>
<li>I streamlined many of the administrative procedures I had created in my previous schools. I rebuilt spreadsheets that had been unchanged for several years rather than hacking old ones to work. Part of this was required to address the fact that my class sizes were substantially larger, but I also decided it was time.</li>
<li>As I had hoped to do, I spent much of the year watching. I did not want to come in and identify everything that this school did not have that I may have had a hand in organizing in past school years, and then add it myself. That is how I came to feel burnt out every time June came around. I was quite picky with what I involved myself in. I said no to things. When I was ready to design a VEX robotics sprint (more on that later) at the end of the year, however, this meant I had the energy and drive to do so. </li>
<li>The level of support I have felt from administrators and colleagues this year has been incredible. Nothing makes you feel so effective as a team that has your back, and that is realistic about what should, what can, and what cannot be accomplished with a given set of resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2> What needs work:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I did not get out and visit my colleagues anywhere nearly as frequently as I wanted. This is a seriously impressive group of teachers trying different things. Part of the problem was my commitment to trying to get things done during my prep periods, so I do take responsibility for that. It would not have been too devastating to that structure, however, if I also planned blocks of time when I would visit specific colleagues. I ate in the lunchroom with colleagues fairly regularly, and that was great for learning what everyone was doing. It was not enough. More of that next year.</li>
<li>I originally planned on doing outreach with parents more regularly this year. They are incredibly trusting of what we as teachers design for students, and this was evident at parent teacher conference nights during both semesters. I want more than that though. I want them to understand my philosophy for why learning mathematics right now is important. I don&#8217;t think the parents understand standards based grading, and although the students made solid attempts to explain it during conferences, these conversations don&#8217;t happen nearly as frequently as they should. I need to think more about what that communication looks like, and why I feel it is important, because I don&#8217;t think I can fully articulate that here. I do know that there is a lost opportunity when it comes to parents really understanding what we do in the classroom on a regular basis.</li>
<li>I now believe that the ease of establishing community and connections with others is inversely related to the ease of living in that place. I often tell the story of how it was easy to rally a group of colleagues in my early days of China to go find cheese, which was difficult to find. Many of my closest bonds were formed during those adventures of first world adversity. Here in District 7 of HCMC, there is no such difficulty. Life is really good and easy here. This means, however, that one must work a little bit harder to leave the comfortable bubble of life to find adventure and make new friends. This is especially the case for me as the father of a now toddling ball of energy. It takes effort and time to build those relationships. That&#8217;s definitely something that I need to work on deliberately planning more frequently next year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The second year anywhere is always less scattered than the first. The next few weeks are all about figuring about how to use the time not spent learning the ropes.</p>

    <p>I posted this graph of cumulative reassessments versus the day of the semester on Twitter:<br>

<p>That, my friends, is a reassessment system gone wild. The appropriate title for that image, as one person pointed out, is <u>Too Many Reassessments</u>. The grand total for this semester was 711. There are obvious bunches of reassessments close to the ends of the quarters when the grade book closes.</p>
<p>Here is a histogram of the reassessment data for the semester. There is some discrepancy in the total number in the data here, but I haven&#8217;t figured out exactly where that is.</p>

<p>I committed to transplanting the system I have used in the past to my new school this year, and didn&#8217;t want to make a full change without seeing how this would play out. This semester I was much more consistent in the types of questions I gave students reassessing, changing grades based on a reassessment, and the choice I offered them for the level of reassessment. <a href="/2017/02/21/sbg-and-leveling-up-part-3-the-machine-thinks/">Some of this I wrote about at the beginning of the semester.</a> </p>
<p>The most important observation I can make at this point is that this system is not sustainable as is. I cannot make my sign-up and credit system more efficient to manage the volume &#8211; that isn&#8217;t the issue. I&#8217;m satisfied with the quality of the questions I give students. I&#8217;ve developed a pretty nice bank of questions that span the spectrum of application, understanding, and transfer. The bigger issue is my capacity to give the sort of feedback I want to give to students <u>throughout</u> the semester. I have many conversations about learning, and many of them are great, but I cannot multiply myself to have as many of those conversations as I want.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a graph of the average learning standards grade for a sample of students compared with the number of reassessments:<br>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/h6h0pgot9k?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t support the expectation that more reassessments implies a higher grade. Students are not necessarily doing machine-gun style reassessment. They <u>are</u> working on specific skills and show my what they are doing. They are responding in a positive way to my feedback. Credits, which students earn by doing work and review of concepts, are still required for students to reassess. Students are for the most part using their credits. Expiring credits, as much as I thought it would make a difference, is not making that much of a difference for behavior (i.e. signing up for reassessments) or course grade. I need to dig into the data more to be able to explain why. </p>
<p>In terms of moving forward, I have many things to think about. </p>
<ul>
<li>The past three or four years have been an exercise in exploring a system that centers around student-initiated reassessment. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s time for that to completely go away, but I wonder about shifting my focus to an assessment structure centered on teacher-initiated. I already do this on unit exams, but I wouldn&#8217;t say it is the focus of where I spend my time. </li>
<li>I wonder if reducing the permitted number of reassessments per student to one per week would improve their effectiveness. This effectiveness increase could be based in higher quality feedback from me, more focused effort on the part of the student for improving understanding on a given learning standard, or something else entirely. This reduces the options for students to learn on their own timeline, which isn&#8217;t a good thing. While we&#8217;re being honest though, that exponential curve at the end of the assessment period is all the evidence I need to accept that the timeline is based on the grading-period structure, not learning.</li>
<li>How do I most efficiently help the weak student that reassesses on the same standard multiple times and makes limited progress on each attempt?</li>
<li>How do I give meaningful guidance to the student that aces everything on the first try? How do I get them more involved in finding learning that is meaningful, rather than waiting for me to tell them what to learn?</li>
<li>What do the students think? I&#8217;ve collected all sorts of anecdotal evidence that students appreciate the opportunities to reassess, and not just in a superficial way related to their course grade. I&#8217;ve given students an end of year survey to complete, and those results are rolling in slowly as students complete their final exams.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the big picture questions that add one more reason to be thankful that the summer is ahead. Getting back to my main point, I am brought back to the idea that quality feedback is the main way we as teachers add value.<a href="/2017/05/06/scaling-in-education/"> This, like many things in education, is not easy to scale.</a> This need for improving and scaling the transfer of feedback is really the only basis for innovation in the ed-tech realm that interests me at all these days. So far, despite the best intentions of many that are trying, machine learning is not the answer yet. Make it easy for me to organize and collect student thinking, respond to that thinking, and give helpful nudges to the resources needed to make progress, and then I&#8217;ll consider your product.</p>
<p>Final exam marking is ahead. Stay tuned.</p>

    <p>I put together an activity using <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/">Desmos Activity Builder</a> that was a variation on an older <a href="http://www.101qs.com/3428-air-traffic-control">air traffic control</a> task as part of my unit on parametric equations and vectors. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some of the copy for the activity:<br>

<p>Students could only see six seconds of the drone animation before they disappeared from the screen. I had students detail their process of finding the intersection point and intersection time as part of the follow up for this activity.</p>
<p>My favorite product of this activity though came with the superposition of everyone&#8217;s models on top of the drone footage. Here&#8217;s that result (click to see the animation):</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.evanweinberg.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/solution.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.evanweinberg.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/solution-1024x544.gif" alt="" width="604" height="321" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2735" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/solution-1024x544.gif 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/solution-300x159.gif 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/solution-768x408.gif 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/solution-1200x638.gif 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a></p>
<p>We had some really productive discussions as part of evaluating this result. The students noticed how most people had the correct initial location, but dramatically different results based on the velocity vectors used to generate the parametric expressions. Some students saw it as cheating to use Desmos to gather data, make calculations to create an approximate solution, and then tweak that solution. I shared that I saw that as a natural role of feedback in the modeling process.   </p>
<p>The activity has one slide with some behind-the-scenes Activity Builder features, and I&#8217;m not sure I should release that at this point. If you are interested in using this activity with your students, let me know, and I can create a version without that slide.</p>

    <!-- .entry-header -->
    <p><a href="http://www.desmos.com/">Desmos</a>, the online graphing calculator, activity builder, and general favorite of the MTBoS does phenomenal work. </p>
<p>I found myself wondering over the past few days about the statistics and probability world and how there isn&#8217;t a Desmos parallel in that realm for easy experimentation. You can put an algebraic expression in Desmos and graph it in a few keystrokes. You can solve a problem algebraically, and then graph to see if you are correct. There are multiple ways to confirm graphically or numerically what you have solved algebraically, or any other permutation of the three. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also easy to put a bunch of marbles in a jar, pick one, replace, and repeat, though this becomes tedious beyond a few trials. Such a small data set often isn&#8217;t enough to really see long term patterns, particularly in cases where you are trying to test whether the theoretical probability you have calculated is correct or not. For subtle cases that involve replacement versus no replacement, the differences between the theoretical probabilities of events are small if there are enough marbles in the jar.  </p>
<p>Creating a simulation and running it half a million times is possible in a spreadsheet or a number of computer languages, but the barrier to entry there is not trivial. I&#8217;ve written simulations myself of various problems and usually make predictions for what I think is going to happen. I then will usually work to find the theoretical probability by hand. </p>
<p>So what would this sort of probability playground look like? There are some examples out there already. <a href="http://technology.cpm.org/general/probability/">Here&#8217;s one from CPM</a> for small numbers of trials. I haven&#8217;t done an exhaustive search, but I haven&#8217;t seen anything that truly allows full experimentation at the level I&#8217;m hoping to achieve. Here are some ideas for what I would love to see exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Natural language definitions for sources of possible outcomes</b>. By this, I mean being able to define outcomes verbally. This might mean &#8220;rain&#8221; and &#8220;no rain&#8221;, with the assumption that having only two labels means these events are complementary. This might mean we define numbers of items for each possible outcome, or simply enter the probability of each as a decimal. The key thing is that I do not want to require labeling events as A or B, and throwing notation around. Let&#8217;s see if we can make this as visual and easy to explore </li>
<li>
<b>Ease of setting up conditional outcomes for compound events.</b>. If event A (I know, I&#8217;m breaking the previous rule here) happens, only B and C are possible, and event D is only possible if event A does <u>not</u> occur. </li>
<li>
<b>Sinks that easily allow for large numbers of trials</b>. I might want to have a single trial be generated a million times &#8211; tell me the proportion of all of the different outcomes. Make it easy for me to count up instances of binomial probability and see how many times, out of ten, I get three or more successes. Tell me when I&#8217;m not looking at all of the possibilities. For example, give me some visual indication that when I&#8217;m picking two marbles from a jar, that if I only have both red or both blue in my possible outcomes, I&#8217;m missing outcomes in which there is one of each.</li>
<li>
<b>Make it easy to tap into existing complex data sets for exploration purposes.</b> Include some data sets that are timely and relevant. The US election comes to mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize also that this is a tall order, but I&#8217;ve seen how far the Desmos team has explored the algebraic/numerical space. Now that they have expanded into the Geometry space through their beta, I wonder if they (or someone else for that matter) has something like this probability exploration tool on their roadmap.</p>

    <!-- .entry-header -->
    <p>I don&#8217;t like projects for assessment. I do like in class projects for the purposes of fostering discussion and other forms of interactions. I decided to put together something fun to build time into the unit while students developed their skills in applying binomial probability. From student feedback, they actually said it was fun, so this wasn&#8217;t just hopeful thinking (this time). This also had the added value of giving students a change to work on Common Core mathematical practice standard 3: <b>Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</b></p>
<p>I gave pairs of groups of students a statement. The center paragraph was the same for both &#8211; a statement about probabilities. The paragraphs preceding and following that were different &#8211; conflicting contexts for each statement. Here&#8217;s an example.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.evanweinberg.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-9.24.06-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.evanweinberg.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-9.24.06-PM-1024x517.png" alt="" width="604" height="305" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2723" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-9.24.06-PM-1024x517.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-9.24.06-PM-300x151.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-9.24.06-PM-768x388.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-9.24.06-PM-1536x776.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-9.24.06-PM-1200x606.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-9.24.06-PM.png 1628w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a></p>
<p>I ended up writing four sets of situations to make sure that each class had at least two groups working on the same probability statement, but <u>different</u> arguments.</p>
<p>I asked students to do calculations and write a 100 word abstract stating their argument. After learning that <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/clips/id1212699939">the Clips app, recently released by Apple</a>, made for a really easy way for students creatively describe and document their thinking, I also asked students to create a two minute video documenting the situation and their argument. You can see a selection of the video results below.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/TdKLdI7Mht0&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1">
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></object></p>
<p>Students were really challenged to search for the calculations and results that supported their arguments. Some reported that they felt dishonest doing so. </p>
<p>You can check out all four sets of scenarios and the rubric I used <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PQiKonXnA_tvLfIgCZTWuNeSaU6wO3h-VzE9wCvr1M/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The students said that working in teams and working through this task was enjoyable and actually reinforced their understanding of how to use binomial probability. As with a previous unit, this project was graded for completion, not for a grade, a fact I stated up front. So far, the students haven&#8217;t actually said this was a problem for them, and the quality of what they produced didn&#8217;t seem to suffer much. </p>

    <!-- .entry-header -->
    <h3>&#8220;I&#8217;m just going to teach it again from the basics.&#8221;</h3>
<p>This approach makes some assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students that didn&#8217;t understand the topic on a first exposure will benefit from just seeing the topic be developed again.</li>
<li>Students that did understand the first time will get confirmation of what they remember.</li>
<li>Colleagues that taught this in the past didn&#8217;t necessarily cover everything, so this ensures students see a complete presentation of the topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are assumptions that serve a teacher-centered classroom model. No teacher wants to be to blame when a student forgets an essential component of knowledge for a given topic, I get that. I have a hard time seeing the presentation of a complete topic as anything other than a checklist of items for a teacher to present. </p>
<p>What does a student <u>do</u> in this context? Why does the student that remembers everything have to sit through tasks that they demonstrably know how to complete? Why would we expect a student that struggled after a first exposure to benefit from seeing the same sequence of topics, but made &#8220;harder&#8221; by some arbitrary measure associated with course or grade?</p>
<p>I prefer the idea that we instead present students with a task that demands the knowledge and skills that are outcomes of the course. Tasks like <a href="http://www.openmiddle.com/">open middle</a> and <a href="http://101qs.com/">3-Act</a> problems let us see where students are in the continuum of knowledge and problem solving. There are plenty of resources we can use to fill in the gaps for students where they exist &#8211; this is where online resources and activities shine. As teachers, we truly add value when we can build intellectual need for what we teach and foster discussion about interesting challenges and thought process. Most importantly, we can provide feedback that is focused and personal.</p>
<p>If I had to identify one fundamental change to my teaching philosophy over the last several years, it would be the acknowledgement that students are not blank slates. Assuming they are doesn&#8217;t serve any of them well. Teaching compliance and patience to the strongest students is a pretty low level goal. Teaching what we say are the basics to those that never understood the basics in the first place disrespects these students as well.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop assuming we need to give our own overview of a topic. We aren&#8217;t as good at it as we think we are. This only reinforces the idea that students are hungry and waiting for us to give them the knowledge they can&#8217;t obtain any other way.</p>
<p>We must aim much higher than that. </p>
