This is exactly the sort of thing I&#039;m looking for - is it possible to do this with a system of equations? Complex numbers? I&#039;m sure it can be done!]]></description>

I completely agree - fractals are my favorite objects to use to illustrate the unpredictable beauty generated through mathematical thinking. The only problem is that they aren&#039;t a focal point of most curricula or classes. My hunt is for images/ads that are evocative of mathematical thinking, aesthetically pleasing, AND are deeply connected to the concepts they will learn in the course. That doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t use fractals, but is it possible to show the beauty of linear equations (for example), a more common element of math classes, in this way?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Evan, 
I like this post. A long time ago, I tried to do something similar and develop an ad campaign for physics under the slogan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://quantumprogress.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/motivational-posters/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&quot;Simplify your life...study physics. &quot;&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
