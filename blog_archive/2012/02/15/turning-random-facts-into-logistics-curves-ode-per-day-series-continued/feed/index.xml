Hey John, 

Thanks for the comment - I hadn&#039;t heard of gist before, it is perfect for this. I used the image because pasting lost the indents and I didn&#039;t have time to fix it, but your solution is better!

I was surprised initially too, but the more I think about it, the more I think that all of the random variables involved make it hard NOT to look like this. Increasing/decreasing the difficulty of the task will scale it horizontally. The type of task does too - I purposely asked two things that would require more than just a quick calculation. 

It would be interesting to pose this to students and ask them to choose a task that would skew the curve in a given way.

There&#039;s a lot of interesting stuff embedded in this - glad to have happened upon it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Evan,
I really like this and never thought you would have gotten such nice data from such a small dataset. One small suggestion from code thieves like me. Could you put your code in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;github gist &lt;/a&gt; so that those who want to play with it can use it?]]></description>
