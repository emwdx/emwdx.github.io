					<description><![CDATA[I am a fan of oral technique, that is, one that is remembered in mind rather than one that exists only in a book.  If then the student can be taught in the same ways as bards or storytellers remembered the practical wisdom of their peoples (since they wrote nothing down), then the student is the better for it, and will take those skills forward into life.

If the rules of a mathematics method can be converted into a symbolic story, the student will be guaranteed to remember it and apply the same into any situation.  It is also useful to consider that the same types of metaphor remains consistent so that they can be shared across all mathematics problems.  I will experiment with this technique when I take a mathematics course later this year.]]></description>
