					<description><![CDATA[I love cards now, but I actually did fail a math test (in 6th grade) because I didn&#039;t know anything about a deck of cards and so couldn&#039;t answer anything correctly despite knowing the probability content just fine.

I really struggle with how to teach probability in a way that doesn&#039;t oversimplify it. I teach AP Stats as well and my students are convinced they know probability because they&#039;ve been answering questions about marbles in bags or dice for years. They assume they&#039;ve got it and it takes them awhile to realize we&#039;ve moved past that and they&#039;ll need to start looking at things in a deeper way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have this same realization about cards myself every few years, as I regularly forget that not everyone is a card-lover like I am.  I think these kinds of experiences are valuable for a few reasons.  

First, this is a great opportunity for student-to-student teaching.  Chances are many students understand the card system, and you can use that to help advance the collaborative culture of your classroom.

Second, it&#039;s a great opportunity to reiterate the importance of asking questions.  People are afraid to admit they don&#039;t know things, but when students know &lt;i&gt;the teacher&lt;/i&gt; can make mistakes (like forgetting to explain what certain things mean), it can make it easier for them to speak up.]]></description>
