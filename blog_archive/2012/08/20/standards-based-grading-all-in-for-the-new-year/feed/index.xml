					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/20/standards-based-grading-all-in-for-the-new-year/#comment-96&quot;&gt;Kevin Krenz (@kevin_krenz)&lt;/a&gt;.

I was going to make this myself - thank you for doing it for me! I completely agree that part of the battle is reassessment. The thing I&#039;ve wondered about (at least under the old system) is whether the process of writing the reflection/request scares students off from actually doing it. They might reason &#039;it doesn&#039;t affect my grade that much, so I&#039;ll just learn it for the test&#039; even though the reflection IS the kick they need to dig in to what they don&#039;t understand. I think by committing to this, I am showing students that this reflection IS what I value.

Thank you for sharing!]]></description>
