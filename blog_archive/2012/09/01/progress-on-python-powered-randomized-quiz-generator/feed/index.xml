Hi Jim,

If you click on the &#039;play&#039; button, you should see the questions pop up one by one. I&#039;ve made some changes since the weekend based on some comments, new things I&#039;ve learned to do, and suggestions from readers and students. Check out the questions and let me know what you think.

Thanks!

Evan]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[awesome idea!  I&#039;ve tried doing something similar with excel, but it was far too restricting in terms of what I needed from it.  I would love to learn how this works, but my programming ability is close to non-existent...

I tried going on this website to see if I can learn how to use what you wrote:
http://repl.it/Chw
but I didn&#039;t even understand what I could do on it!

If you could offer some instructions, I would love to be a beta tester!

Thanks!]]></description>
