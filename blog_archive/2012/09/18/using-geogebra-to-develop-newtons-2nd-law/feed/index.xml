					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/09/18/using-geogebra-to-develop-newtons-2nd-law/#comment-119&quot;&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt;.

Sorry for the delay Phil! Geogebra makes it pretty easy to put something like this together. It has the ability to parametrically define coordinates, and then adjust a parameter with a slider. I added some conditions for showing/not showing objects, but that was about it.

It&#039;s good you haven&#039;t run into problems - I have always loved using Tracker. I installed it on my new Macbook Air, and I suddenly lost control of my wifi and ended up having to reset things. I installed it on two student laptops (new Macbook pros) and the computer rebooted and never was able to get past the boot screen. The OS had to be reinstalled. A headache for many people involved, but luckily it was only about a week into school, so the students didn&#039;t lose too much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your geogebra applet. I will be using it in my class. I haven&#039;t used geogebra before, how long did it take you to put this together? 

I&#039;ve also plan to use Tracker extensively this year on a school supplied MacbookPro, so I wasn&#039;t too thrilled to read your comments about it. Fortunately I haven&#039;t run into any issues (fingers crossed).]]></description>
