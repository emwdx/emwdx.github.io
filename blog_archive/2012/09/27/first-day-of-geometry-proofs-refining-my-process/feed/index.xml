I&#039;ll try to do that - some of my stuff is cobbled together from textbooks, but I&#039;m sure I can get some of the meatier handouts up there. Thanks for asking.]]></description>

Hi John - I&#039;m sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you. Between being away during the national holiday and then taking the Grade 11 and 12 students on a trip last week, I&#039;ve been away from the blog for a while.

I do all of the editing in Camtasia for Mac - I really like the interface, especially when using my Wacom tablet. I am finding though that I am too much of a perfectionist for the videos, so I am editing a lot. It&#039;s still about a 5:1 ratio of editing to recording time. It&#039;s keeping me from recording as many videos as I want to be making - great is the enemy of good here. Part of that is to keep my video length to 2 - 3 minutes, but I think I need to learn to let that go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Evan, I like this, and it reminds me that I&#039;ve forgotten the names of all the various properties of equality. It also shows me how I could deepen my &lt;a href=&quot;https://quantumprogress.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/algebra-moves-legal-vs-smart/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Legal vs Smart&lt;/a&gt; algebra moves discussion. 

One other question, which I have a feeling you may have covered earlier in one of your posts on screencasts. How are you able to make stuff, like the writing of the equation &quot;x+5=7&quot; just appear on the screen? Are you just editing out the writing in post production, or have you set up some sort of keyboard macros to drop in pre-written things?]]></description>
