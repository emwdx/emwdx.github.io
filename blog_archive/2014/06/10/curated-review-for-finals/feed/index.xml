Hi David,

I completely agree - showing them their own mistakes would be an even better way to start this discussion. I&#039;ve been using an app I wrote to collect student work by taking pictures through my phone, and I now have a whole folder of great images of student work to use. I&#039;d really like to have this work collect online so that students can comment on it themselves - something along the lines of the Math Mistakes blog where students can comment and up vote each other&#039;s work.

Great thought here - thanks for the idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another option is to take examples of student work you have collected through-out the year, and presenting it (make it anonymous) back to students to revise and work on. If you choose work which highlights some of the common conceptions students have, they can really benefit from discussing the approaches they see, and making sense of them, and then either constructing an ideal response or writing feedback to the student together. They also get a chance to see the material they have done during the year again.]]></description>
