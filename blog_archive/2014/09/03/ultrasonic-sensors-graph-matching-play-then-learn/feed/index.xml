					<description><![CDATA[Why can&#039;t preservice math teachers learn about these real constructivist methods of learning, so that they have the tools that they need to use when confronted by a paleolithic boss who demands correct answers instead of general learning? The best thing about this activity, exactly as you describe it, is that there are no numbers for principals or charter school executives to demand the kids use in a color-by-numbers fashion.

At the blog for which I write (www.mathnook.com/blog) we show how the higher brain can be liberated to think conceptually by making the number facts and other math bits that the student needs to get from concept to solution automatic. This exercise stands even our thinking on its head by stripping out the number component of a problem entirely, compelling a firm conceptual foundation before the &quot;how-to&#039;s&quot; are introduced.]]></description>
