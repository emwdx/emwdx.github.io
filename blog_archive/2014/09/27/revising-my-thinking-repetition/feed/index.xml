					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/27/revising-my-thinking-repetition/#comment-315&quot;&gt;Andy &quot;SuperFly&quot; Rundquist&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Andy. I haven&#039;t thought out exactly what this means in terms of what I will do in planning for classes next week. One way might mean that the class as a whole attempts a large bank of problems so there is some group wide accountability or incentive to work through them. The big obstacle I see is that a social classroom is not an environment in which focus is easy to establish or maintain. The mental demand of assembling pens is also low compared to answering questions in math or physics. Those two factors are keeping me from changing my approach completely. That said, there is obviously something here to investigate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Hurry them along&quot;, &quot;tell them what they should feel&quot;, &quot;underestimate...&quot; :  these phrases jumped out of your analysis. Time constraints imposed by pacing guides and testing requirements have given teachers a need to impart so much. Perhaps we teachers are guilty of this damage to our children&#039;s learning without remembering the bit about experience being the best teacher. Our children are no less capable than we are at appreciating and improving on tasks; we just have to give them time... To experience, to explore, to feel and think and make mistakes and experiment with possible solutions. As teachers, perhaps we need to demand this time for our students. To build this in to our pacing guides might just be the solution to this disconnect students feel in our classrooms. I&#039;m making it a priority this year. I already see the difference this exploration makes. (My recent post:  http://the30thvoice.wordpress.com/?p=389 is now much clearer to me in light of why the students were so engaged!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I was thinking just the same thoughts as you were about my own classroom as I read the first part about the baskets. I tell people all the time that my students would get more out of class if they did this sort of practice on their own. Of course, not many of my students do, but this post has me thinking about how a social aspect of repetition can be helpful. What do you think would be a cool way to test this in class? At the level of a single formula lots of times? The level of goal-less problems over and over? I&#039;m not sure.]]></description>
