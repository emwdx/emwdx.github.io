Sorry about that, Xavier. I haven&#039;t had time to add detailed instructions for installing this yourself. One thing you might do is look in the .meteor directory and look at the packages file to see which Meteor packages I have installed. These are required for everything to work properly.]]></description>

Nothing quite that complex at this time, Xavier. I use the Khan Academy KaTEX library to do some typesetting for my randomized quiz questions. 

&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/30/another-weinbergcloud-update/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;If you look at this post&lt;/a&gt;, you&#039;ll see a video that shows the current state of my program, warts and all. I might switch some things around this summer, so stay tuned.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does your cloud allow to create activities like 3-acts? Does I can pass from googlem form [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vSwM2Hb-UVIJsoywWRbNeeLybp3ZcnOWaFV-2XKXP1g/viewform] to your cloud? Does your cloud allow latex/mathematical typesetting? Can we set a section as a precondition for another. For example, if after some section, students need to answer a number. If this number is below 1000 then they could follow. Else, not.

I will try to use your cloud for assess modelization of students. I did not find any more useful tool

Thanks a lot,]]></description>

Hi Sarah,
One of my summer plans is to make this easier to install and give instructions for running it yourself. Stay tuned.]]></description>

Hi Evan -

This is my first time using Meteor, so I was wondering if there were instructions on how to load the source code to get it running. Thanks!]]></description>

The database part and the web serving part would have worked fine using just Bottle, which is why it has been enough for my in class quiz program. Meteor provides the user authorization part, which would have been a real pain in the neck to write myself. With Meteor, I type &#039;meteor add accounts-ui&#039; and I have all of that functionality. This means I can look at individual students and their reassessment patterns, and have the emails that students are actually using to log in for use if I need to email them directly. 

I like the idea of having a deadline, but and could definitely put that in as a requirement. I&#039;ve thought about having them submit a photo of their work along with their request, as you do. Right now, I&#039;m reasonably happy with the system. The students have learned how to use it (and unfortunately game it a bit) which means it&#039;s time to use the summer to tighten things up a bit.]]></description>

Do you think Bottle would have worked okay for your sign-up web app?
I wish I had the skillz to collaborate with you on Meteor. I don&#039;t, but I have another idea that helped my students (ie me).  I have a deadline 4 days ahead of the assessment date for them to apply and show work.  This doesn&#039;t get rid of cramming the night before, it&#039;s even better - it gets the kids to study twice before doing the re-assessment!]]></description>
