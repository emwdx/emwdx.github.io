I haven&#039;t done anything with Monte Carlo, no, but it seems like a good way to convince others (and me) of what the right approach might be.The fact I didn&#039;t jump to a computational approach must mean I&#039;m rusty - thanks for the suggestion!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the line about it never being THE conversation. We take up a week&#039;s worth of time in one of our early labs in our curriculum on it and then just hit it lightly again in the rest of the labs. In the Global Physics Department we had an interesting conversation about how to teach this, with the montecarlo approach getting the biggest support (that&#039;s certainly what I push). What I&#039;d like to do more of is experiments with much more repetitive data to really show true histograms. Do you do any of that?]]></description>
