Wordle would have worked too, but it wouldn&#039;t have let me exclude as many words as I was able to exclude using my custom solution. Thank you for the suggestion.

I&#039;ve never thought so carefully about vocabulary until lately when it is the primary stumbling block for students in IB physics. The mathematics doesn&#039;t even come to play until the students understand what is actually being discussed in a problem.]]></description>

Hi Chris,

Those really look useful - I&#039;ll send my students there. The more I teach, I find that deliberate work on vocabulary is a necessity. This has become more true as I think about my own assumptions about using vocabulary. &#039;Speeding up&#039; is a great example - a student new to English might assume this means moving upwards. It&#039;s important not to overlook the colloquial language as an obstacle for these students.

I&#039;m a big fan of your work Chris - thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting how words are used in exam questions. I&#039;m always unintentionally confusing my students with expressions like &quot;speeding up&quot; and &quot;slowing down&quot;. I started making some quizlets ( http://quizlet.com/subject/chrishamper/ ) of words for each section of the syllabus. Not sure how useful they are but anyone is welcome to use them]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for parsing the list - I would probably just have used wordle! I am a for believer in teaching the more formal and rich testing vocabulary to my kids. I think it is the reason students do so poorly on tests. We don&#039;t talk or teach in that formal structure, so it doesn&#039;t make sense for students without the level of vocabulary. I also believe it is critical to teach the terms in context - and in math, that usage is often very different than regular language usage. I think you are on the right track!]]></description>
