					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my try at a math twine. I&#039;d really love any feedback: http://twinery.org/2/#stories/311e9a3a-69d3-ee67-6f51-33ba43314dfc/play

It was a bit labor intensive, but mostly because I wanted pictures. I wound up loading them to photobucket and using the  tag.]]></description>

Have either of y&#039;all played with Oppia? It allows you to send a response based on any kind of input. I thought it had a lot of potential, but took way too long for me to build. I&#039;ve been wanting to do something like this though, so I&#039;m excited to try out Twine, thanks for sharing Evan!]]></description>

That&#039;s definitely a concern. Its easy to handle for compare tasks, but challenging otherwise.  Some JS might make it possible to show/hide links based on an entered numerical value. Combining a back end to collect data would also make this really powerful. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool idea! The only struggle I have thinking about this is how to predict the types of mistakes students will make. That&#039;s, of course, the same problem with any sort of multiple choice approach. I wonder what it would take to make it handle any numeric response from the student?]]></description>
