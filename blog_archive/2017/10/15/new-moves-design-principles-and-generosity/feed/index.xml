I don&#039;t think it does, at least not in my experience. I think the bigger thing is that it forces you to focus your attention on the single task in front of you rather than on where you are in a list. In a video game (like Super Mario world), you only see the big map of all of the places you need to visit when you aren&#039;t involved in a single level. I think it&#039;s sometimes nice to force that sort of limited view in other contexts as well.]]></description>

Well said. There is something liberating about having a single idea visible at a time. The economics of digital space makes this a possibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In your view, does more breathing room also mean more time between activities?

I&#039;d love to learn more about design thinking.  Where did you learn about alignment, proximity, repetition, and contrast?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I teach a mix of students, 9th grade Alg 1. I have found myself putting less and less on each page, one thing, where there might have been 12 before. This ‘white space’ seems to give my students more focus, more time, to think about the problem. The student ‘packet’ is the current vogue at my school. I look at it and my insides yell ‘noooooo.’ What a terrible, stifling thing. We need to give rich tasks- one at a time. Our children will learn more from this than all the carefully structured levels of practice and guided notes. We must give them room to process what they are learning, thinking, doing. It takes a brave teacher to trust in this messy work. To be sensitive enough to their audience, to have the Toolkit... to take the time for exploration. Yes, we still have paper, but we need less of it than we think.]]></description>
