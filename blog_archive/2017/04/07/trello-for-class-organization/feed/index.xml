And then this catches my eye while I&#039;m reading today...a compelling reason to go analog.

I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s much added value of the analog post-it note. I like the portability of the digital version, and the ease of getting started by copying the new set of tasks. I imagine that the process of copying down tasks would take time that I&#039;m not sure I want to give up. I guess this is something I could ask the students, but I don&#039;t expect them to be excited to include a hand-written step.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really cool idea. I&#039;ve really liked how Trello can help my student research groups work together and understand where things are at. I haven&#039;t really used the &quot;sprint&quot; idea from agile, though, and I&#039;m intrigued by what you&#039;ve said here. The first &quot;could be improved&quot; comment was interesting (seems like self-teaching), especially when coupled with your comment about the different work you had to do.

My question: did the cool tech help or would doing this with post-it notes work as well?]]></description>
