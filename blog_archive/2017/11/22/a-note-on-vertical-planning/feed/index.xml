					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/22/a-note-on-vertical-planning/#comment-519&quot;&gt;Andy &quot;SuperFly&quot; Rundquist&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for this, Andy.

I think we need people on both sides compiling their X and Y. 

I&#039;ve met many teachers over my career that claim college preparation is the goal, but then use this as an excuse to teach like they think courses at university are taught (i.e. a focus on lecture and struggling blindly for hours until a solution is found). I don&#039;t think this is actually the case at university either - that is why I love hearing from people like you that I know experiment with a number of models for effective use of class time. But I also don&#039;t know what things are really like now. My university experience was a really great mix of different types of learning experiences.

Thoughts like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-m-parsons/message-to-my-freshman-st_b_7275016.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;those linked here&lt;/a&gt; make me think we have a long way to go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve hit the nail on the head. These last few years I&#039;ve thought about this a lot as my own children have been in high school. I&#039;m happy that I&#039;ve found connections with both HS and college physics teachers, but this post reminds me that I could learn from non-physics teachers as well. 

I think I could both leverage X and Y better in my teaching and communicate more about the X&#039; and Y&#039; that I plan to teach, and learn more about the X&#039;&#039; and Y&#039;&#039; that HS teachers think would help HS students learn.

My X&#039; and Y&#039;: Differntial equations foundation of physics and design a lab from scratch to help learn about a standard (or learning objective).]]></description>
