Most people have crafted their own solutions in some way - many of them are analog. As I say here, despite the work I&#039;ve put into this digital solution, it&#039;s still messy and time consuming. I still expect to look at everyone&#039;s papers because I value the assessment information I get from them. The time that takes is non-negligible. It&#039;s also something I&#039;m not willing to outsource to a computer at this point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I came down hard on personalized learning last week, this is the sort of problem that really demands &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of personalization solution. It&#039;s just unreasonably hard for a single teacher to give every student a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; assessment on an arbitrary topic at an arbitrary time. I don&#039;t like most of the solutions I&#039;ve seen so far, but this needs one.]]></description>
