Realizing that the true value you get out of a project is the satisfaction of completing it is an important step in the process.

Thanks for sharing, Andy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the honest description of why you stepped away from a project. I found myself nodding my head as you talked about how you realized there was another way, even if it was one you might not be as proud of (I don&#039;t mean you&#039;d be embarrassed by the other one, just that you had something that you created on your own that gave you joy, and now needed to use something else that worked great but you couldn&#039;t claim that you invented it). I face decisions like that all the time. Earlier this week I spent 2 days making cool visuals of how students change majors at my institution. On the third day I showed it to a colleague and he said, &quot;oh, just like this report from EAB (our data management partner)&quot;. I realized that the EAB system is much better suited for others to play with the data and I realized that I hadn&#039;t even looked around when first starting my version of the project. I know why. It was because it was fun and I figured others would appreciate it and me. So anyways, thanks for this great insight into how you dealt with a similar situation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am chunking content in my Alg 1 class b/c of learning issues. I want to make sure that I give the kids ways to see the content and have an opportunity to show progress. I have not used quizzes as extensively as each standard, but I think this will be something I will build into next semester to help my kids see where they are... I want them to be more successful on their tests, which my district grading system weights at over 50% of grade (across district/summative assessments). They need a better way to see where they are academically. We are also using google for ed and I love the calendar functionality!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/22/a-note-on-vertical-planning/#comment-519&quot;&gt;Andy &quot;SuperFly&quot; Rundquist&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for this, Andy.

I think we need people on both sides compiling their X and Y. 

I&#039;ve met many teachers over my career that claim college preparation is the goal, but then use this as an excuse to teach like they think courses at university are taught (i.e. a focus on lecture and struggling blindly for hours until a solution is found). I don&#039;t think this is actually the case at university either - that is why I love hearing from people like you that I know experiment with a number of models for effective use of class time. But I also don&#039;t know what things are really like now. My university experience was a really great mix of different types of learning experiences.

Thoughts like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-m-parsons/message-to-my-freshman-st_b_7275016.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;those linked here&lt;/a&gt; make me think we have a long way to go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve hit the nail on the head. These last few years I&#039;ve thought about this a lot as my own children have been in high school. I&#039;m happy that I&#039;ve found connections with both HS and college physics teachers, but this post reminds me that I could learn from non-physics teachers as well. 

I think I could both leverage X and Y better in my teaching and communicate more about the X&#039; and Y&#039; that I plan to teach, and learn more about the X&#039;&#039; and Y&#039;&#039; that HS teachers think would help HS students learn.

My X&#039; and Y&#039;: Differntial equations foundation of physics and design a lab from scratch to help learn about a standard (or learning objective).]]></description>

I don&#039;t think it does, at least not in my experience. I think the bigger thing is that it forces you to focus your attention on the single task in front of you rather than on where you are in a list. In a video game (like Super Mario world), you only see the big map of all of the places you need to visit when you aren&#039;t involved in a single level. I think it&#039;s sometimes nice to force that sort of limited view in other contexts as well.]]></description>
