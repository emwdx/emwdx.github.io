					<description><![CDATA[This post is great. I too have been struggling with the idea that I do most of the cognitive heavy lifting (in planning the &quot;perfect&quot; lessons) only to see minimum gains from students. I really like your approach to this--First set your priorities and plan lessons and assessments to match your priorities(not easy but worth it). Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My colleague and I are getting ready to plan the unit &quot;starters&quot; for next year. Your three priorities echo ours, and summarize them beautifully! I am going to use your last paragraph as guiding statements as we identify the resources to kick start those cognitive conundrums for our students. I agree with your assessment of a presentation - I began this year keeping my part to a brief intro, basically saying, here it is - what do you see/think/connect? And then getting out of the way to work with students individually. The results have been good! Next year will be even better.]]></description>
