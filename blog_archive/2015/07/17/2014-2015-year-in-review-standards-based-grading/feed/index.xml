Thanks for the feedback - I think that&#039;s the first thing I&#039;ll adjust for the reasons you mentioned.

I haven&#039;t heard much from others on how they translate from mastery levels to grades for reporting, especially in terms of communicating those levels. I&#039;m curious what you (and others) do in this regard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Changing from 1-5 to 6-10: genius. Definitely doing that next year.
I think the expiring credits is a good idea. We want students to see these assessments as a part of their learning process, not the end of it; students who say they need more time before testing aren&#039;t really grasping that idea. As long as they have ways to earn credits to take the test again at the time they would have originally planned to assess, you&#039;re not really changing anything for them.]]></description>
