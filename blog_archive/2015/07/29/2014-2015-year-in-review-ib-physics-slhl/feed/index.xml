					<description><![CDATA[Hi Danny,

Those are tricky ones, but I do know the AMTA members site has some materials on modeling atomic structure from the chemistry folks. I&#039;m likely going to do some online activities that center on the failure of atomic models as the basis for needing new ones, as that taps nicely into concepts from the IB Theory of Knowledge course. 

As for energy generation, I&#039;m not sure. My plan is to do some analysis of the actual power sources here in China to figure out where the electricity comes from. In the US there&#039;s a lot more info, so this will actually take some detective work on the part of my students.

Thanks for writing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Evan, totally agree about the effectiveness of Modeling. Have you thought about how you&#039;ll model or do labs with units 7 and 8 (atomic/etc and energy production)?]]></description>
