					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve clearly hacked into my to-do list, Doug.

I&#039;d love to have a draggable system for making this happen. It was something I started mucking around with in Python last year, grumbling that it still wasn&#039;t as convenient as having it docked into my Meteor apps with student names already loaded in. 

Stay tuned - thanks for the nudge in the right direction!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very cool. I wrote a similar program in Python with some added &quot;graphics&quot;. My script is a lot messier than yours though (it was my first python program)! https://github.com/shmish/Student-Scrambler


For my current program, I have to manually edit my class list text file before running my program.  I&#039;m always looking for improvements and learning some programming along the way.  What I&#039;m working on now, and what you could probably do 10X faster than me if you wanted: moving the script to a web app. I tested out the moving/sorting with javascript and jquery, that went smooth. I&#039;m now learning django so that I can have a db of class lists. I know that you have been using Meteor, this would be a nice step forward for your program. You can load a class into your db and then on any given day you pull up your class in your browser, add/remove students from the student list (using some jquery I think?) and then run the sort.]]></description>
