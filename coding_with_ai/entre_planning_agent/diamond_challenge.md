Timeline: Day 1: **Reconnection and Entrepreneurial Mindset.** Reintroduce the course and establish a personal connection through the teacher’s entrepreneurial journey. Students share "aha" moments from the break to spark inspiration and reconnect with their team’s passion. Homework: Deep dive into Diamond Challenge judge feedback to identify specific gaps in the original narrative and video submission.

Day 2: **Evidence Analysis and Content Iteration.** Using the judge feedback, students engage in a secondary "Investigation" phase (MISO+T) to see if further evidence is needed to support their claims. Focus on refining the "Problem Definition" and "Market Empathy" sections of their slide deck to ensure they are responding directly to the critiques of their initial concept narrative.

Day 3: **Pitch Prototyping and Delivery Benchmark.** Students deliver live practice presentations to the new teacher for the first time. This serves as a "Testing" phase for their verbal communication. The instructor provides targeted feedback on "Presentation Skills," specifically focusing on the elimination of filler words (um, so, basically) and assessing how well the content reflects the necessary iterations from Day 2.

Day 4: **Refining and Final Polish.** Focus on "Slide Design" and visual storytelling to complement the verbal pitch. Students undergo a final "Iteration" cycle, practicing in peer-to-peer groups to ensure flow, timing, and confidence. Final drill-down on reducing filler words and ensuring the "Solution" and "Prototyping" slides are visually compelling and data-backed for external judges.

Day 5: **The Diamond Challenge Presentation.** Students present their final slide decks to external judges. This represents the "Final Pitch" and external validation phase of the entrepreneurship cycle. Assessment focuses on the professional delivery of the pitch, the integration of previous feedback, and the ability to communicate their entrepreneurial vision clearly and persuasively.

Design Cycle:
### Day 1: Reconnection and Entrepreneurial Mindset
*   **"Aha" Speed Dating (Empathy & Mindset):** Arrange students in two concentric circles facing each other. Every 2 minutes, students rotate and share an "aha" moment from the break—personal, project-related, or a new observation of a problem in the wild. This re-establishes team empathy and primes the "Entrepreneurial Eye" for noticing opportunities.
*   **The Founder’s Map (Reflective Connection):** After the instructor shares their journey, students create a quick visual timeline of their own project's "Highs and Lows" from last semester. They must identify one specific moment where they demonstrated an "Entrepreneurial Mindset" (resilience, pivot, or curiosity) to share with the new instructor.

### Day 2: Evidence Analysis and Content Iteration
*   **The Judge Feedback Matrix (Define & Test):** Teams categorize judge feedback into three buckets: "Missing Evidence," "Unclear Narrative," or "Weak Value Prop." Using the MISO+T framework, they must identify which specific research method (e.g., a new Interview or a data Survey) will provide the evidence needed to "win" that critique.
*   **The "So What?" Challenge (Market Empathy):** For every claim in their Problem and Market slides, teams must answer "So what?" three times. This forces them to move past surface-level stats and reach the deep "Market Empathy" required to prove they understand the user's emotional and financial pain points.

### Day 3: Pitch Prototyping and Delivery Benchmark
*   **The "Stoplight" Benchmark (Testing & Feedback):** Each team delivers their current pitch live. The instructor provides immediate "Stoplight" feedback: Green (keep this), Yellow (needs more evidence/clarity), and Red (remove filler words or confusing visuals). This serves as a "verbal prototype" to see if the Day 2 iterations actually land.
*   **Filler Word Tally & The "Power Pause" (Refining):** While one team pitches, a "shadow team" tallies filler words (um, like, so). Post-pitch, the team practices a 60-second "Power Pause" drill, where they must explain their solution while intentionally pausing for three seconds between every two sentences to master silence over fillers.

### Day 4: Refining and Final Polish
*   **The 3-Second "Glance Test" (Slide Prototyping):** Students cycle through their slide decks. Peers have only 3 seconds to look at each slide and must state the "Main Takeaway." If the peer can't identify it, the team must redesign for visual storytelling—reducing text and increasing data-backed imagery or prototypes.
*   **The Tag-Team Transition Drill (Team Execution):** Teams practice the "Hand-off." One member speaks, and the next must pick up the narrative without looking at the screen or using a verbal cue like "Next slide." This builds the appearance of a unified, high-execution team, which is critical for external validation.

### Day 5: The Diamond Challenge Presentation
*   **The Q&A "Stress Test" (Validation):** Before the final pitch, teams brainstorm the three "scariest" questions a judge could ask based on their weaknesses. They prepare "Appendix Slides" with extra data to pull up during Q&A, demonstrating evidence-based decision-making.
*   **Final Pitch & External Validation:** Students deliver their polished 5-minute pitch to the judges. Success is measured not just by the score, but by the team's ability to integrate previous feedback and handle the Q&A with professional poise and data-backed confidence.

Assessment:
### Day 1

*   **L1.5 Assessment (SELF_DIRECTION):** During the **"Aha" Speed Dating** session, students share an observation from their break. A student at this level can recall an "aha" moment but struggles to explain what was learned from it or how it relates to the concept of "curiosity" or "grit" (partial knowledge of the 2.0 self-reflection process).
*   **L2 Assessment (GROUP_MEMBER_SKILLS):** In **The Founder’s Map** activity, students must collaborate with their teams to align their personal timelines. A student at this level demonstrates foundational skills by arriving to class with their "aha" thoughts prepared, participating in the discussion with empathy, and adhering to established collaborative norms.
*   **L3 Assessment (CREATIVE_PROBLEM_SOLVING):** After creating the visual timeline, students evaluate their previous project iterations. A student at this level applies iterative methods to reflect on the efficacy of their past solutions, justifying how their specific "Highs and Lows" represent a response to authentic problems encountered last semester.

### Day 2

*   **L1.5 Assessment (INVESTIGATION):** While completing the **Judge Feedback Matrix**, students can identify that feedback exists but show major errors in categorizing which MISO+T (Media, Interview, Survey, Observation, Test) method is required to address the critique (partial knowledge of the 2.0 inquiry process).
*   **L2 Assessment (WRITTEN_COMMUNICATION):** For **The "So What?" Challenge**, students draft updated claims for their market slides. A student at this level uses deliberate strategies to engage an audience by outlining their reasoning and ensuring their written claims follow the conventions of a professional pitch deck.
*   **L3 Assessment (INVESTIGATION):** Teams synthesize the judge feedback with new research targets. A student at this level locates and evaluates information from a wide range of sources (MISO+T) to display a deep understanding of the authentic problem and evaluates why their current solution is the most viable based on that evidence.

### Day 3

*   **L1.5 Assessment (VERBAL_VISUAL_COMMUNICATION):** During **The "Stoplight" Benchmark** pitch, a student delivers their content but demonstrates major omissions in non-verbal communication and the "5Ps" (Planning, Preparation, Practice, Performance, Passion), such as failing to make eye contact or relying entirely on a script (partial 2.0 content).
*   **L2 Assessment (SELF_DIRECTION):** Following the **Filler Word Tally**, students are tasked with organizing a "Power Pause" drill. A student at this level performs the basic process of evaluating the efficacy of their choice to pause and asks clarifying questions to the teacher to refine their delivery.
*   **L3 Assessment (GROUP_MEMBER_SKILLS):** During the feedback session, students provide and receive constructive critiques. A student at this level makes meaningful contributions to the team’s "Stoplight" iterations, communicating an overarching idea for improvement and ensuring the feedback loop is collaborative and productive.

### Day 4

*   **L1.5 Assessment (WRITTEN_COMMUNICATION):** In **The 3-Second "Glance Test"**, students attempt to revise their slide text. A student at this level may change the font or add an image but fails to organize the message or argument clearly, showing major errors in audience awareness (partial knowledge of 2.0 conventions).
*   **L2 Assessment (VERBAL_VISUAL_COMMUNICATION):** During **The Tag-Team Transition Drill**, students practice their hand-offs. A student at this level demonstrates the "Practice" and "Performance" stages of the 5Ps by seeking feedback on their transitions and ensuring they do not use verbal cues like "next slide."
*   **L3 Assessment (VERBAL_VISUAL_COMMUNICATION):** Students finalize their slide decks for the competition. A student at this level leverages specific design and presentation techniques (data visualization, storytelling) to engage their peers in a practiced multimedia presentation that requires minimal referencing of notes.

### Day 5

*   **L1.5 Assessment (INVESTIGATION):** During **The Q&A "Stress Test"**, a student attempts to answer a judge's question using data but has major errors in the synthesis of that information, failing to reach a logical conclusion based on their research sources (partial 2.0 inquiry).
*   **L2 Assessment (SELF_DIRECTION):** While preparing **Appendix Slides**, students demonstrate self-regulation by identifying the "scariest" questions and organizing a task list of data points to address them, completing the work on time for the final pitch.
*   **L3 Assessment (CREATIVE_PROBLEM_SOLVING):** During the **Final Pitch & External Validation**, students present their final product. A student at this level applies iterative methods to reflect on the efficacy of their solution, explaining and justifying how their developed product demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem and the task objectives defined by the Diamond Challenge.
