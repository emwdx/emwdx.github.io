| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Score 2.0:**  The building blocks of the learning.  Focus on content/vocabulary  that should be mastered by the learner rather than trying to include all the knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish the Score 3.0.  The goal is not to create a massive checklist of foundational knowledge, and skills learners must move through to be determined proficient. The learning goal is the Scale Level 3.0 target statement. Score 2.0 will likely align to lower levels of Bloom’s taxonomy and/or DOK Level 2\.  Typical command terms:  List, Explain, Discuss, Identify, Describe, Compare | **Score 3.0**  The priority standard(s). At times, multiple standards may be included in one proficiency scale. Criteria to determine if multiple standards can be included (covariance): They can be taught together They can and should be measured together Standards often align to upper levels of Bloom’s taxonomy and/or DOK Level 3 or Marzano’s New Taxonomy. Typical command terms:  Apply, Analyze, Contrast, Interpret, Synthesize, Similar Transfer | **Score 4.0**  In depth inferences and application and/or deeper levels of complexity, sophistication, and/or transfer.  Score 4.0 does not equate to more work or learning at the next grade level, but rather a higher level of performance that integrates and applies the contents of the entire scale. Teams will determine one sample 4.0 score task, and be open to other student demonstrations of deep learning. Score 4.0 tasks will likely align to upper levels of Bloom’s taxonomy and/or DOK Level 4\.  Typical command terms:  Evaluate, Infer, Conclude, Dissimilar Transfer  |

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Puntaje 2.0:**  Construcción de bloques de aprendizaje.  Céntrese en el contenido/vocabulario que el alumno debe dominar en lugar de intentar incluir todos los conocimientos y destrezas necesarios para alcanzar el 3.0.  El objetivo no es crear una lista de cotejo de conocimientos y destrezas, sino tener en cuenta que lo observado debe ir en línea con el logro del objetivo de aprendizaje enunciado en 3.0 La puntuación 2.0 se ajustará probablemente a los niveles inferiores de la taxonomía de Bloom y/o al nivel 2 del DOK (tabla de comprensión profunda).  Términos más usados:  Enumerar, Explicar, Discutir, Identificar, Describir, Comparar. | **Puntaje 3.0**  Objetivo de Aprendizaje/estándar. En ocasiones, pueden incluirse múltiples estándares (OA’s) en una escala de competencia.  Los criterios para determinar si se incluyen múltiples estándares: Ambos estándares/OA’s pueden enseñarse al mismo tiempo. Se puede y deben ser medidos juntos.  Los OA’s/estándares generalmente se alinean a niveles superiores de la taxonomía de Bloom y/o al nivel 3 de DOK.  Términos más usados:  Aplicar, Analizar, Contrastar, Interpretar, Sintetizar, Transferencia similar  | **Puntaje 4.0**  Inferencias profundas y aplicación en niveles de mayor complejidad, sofisticación y/o transferencia.  4.0 no equivale a más trabajo o aprendizaje en el grado siguiente, sino a un nivel superior de rendimiento que integra y aplica los contenidos de toda la escala. Teams will determine one sample 4.0 score task, and be open to other student demonstrations of deep learning. Score 4.0 tasks will likely align to upper levels of Bloom’s taxonomy and/or DOK Level 4\.  Typical command terms:  Evaluate, Infer, Conclude, Dissimilar Transfer  |
