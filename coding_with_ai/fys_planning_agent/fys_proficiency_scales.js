For example,  The student is able to create a positive and safe space for group members to contribute ideas, give feedback, build upon the ideas of others, and create products that represent equity in voice.  They are able to self-reflect and use feedback from peers and teachers to adapt collaboration skills to different settings and people.",
            "3.0": "Students demonstrates a collaborative mindset with a variety of peers in multiple contexts (situations, activities, and projects) by: Bringing together many different ideas in order to work towards a common goal.  Seeking differing opinions and integrating diverse perspectives into the process and final product. Accurately reflecting on their role and responsibility in a group to identify strengths and areas of growth.",

Coming to group meetings prepared with the required materials and/or work complete Being dependable and accountable for their portion of the work  Assisting others in solving problems. Asking for help in identifying and achieving goals and solving problems. Selecting and applying appropriate collaborative tools (including tech), skills, and strategies                                for productive group work. Demonstrates social intelligence by: Stating personal opinions and areas of disagreement tactfully.  Acknowledging others’ skill, experience, creativity and contributions. Sharing credit for good ideas with others."

This means the learner will  integrate information from potential users in the design process develop a prototype of an idea to meet that need or challenge revise elements of a prototype based on new information, testing, and/or feedback.  move between different stages of the design process in response to new information.  Students can demonstrate flexibility, perseverance, and the ability to work with open-ended problems throughout the process.",
